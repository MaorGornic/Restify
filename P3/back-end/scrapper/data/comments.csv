Wow... Loved this place.
I learned that if an electric slicer is used the blade becomes hot enough to start to cook the prosciutto.
But they don't clean the chiles?
Crust is not good.
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
Pancake was WAY bigger than I thought and kind of regretted getting now since I couldn't finish it.
Thai Orchid's menu offers a vast choice of authentic Thai dishes.
I guess if you're eating here
Sure
My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
Price was very reasonable.
Watery espresso with no crema--none.
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
They seem to be sautéed and are in large chunks not wussy little minced things.
The fries were great too.
A great touch.
That wasn't even all that great to begin with?
One of the amazing berry crumb pies?
We ordered 2 $.99 Margaritas - they couldnt get the machine to work because it was frozen so refunded our money.
Service was very prompt.
Would not go back.
I never know who is my actual server or who to order anything from.
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
Oh Sura... A Carnivore's Playground!
I tried the Cape Cod ravoli
I suggest upgrading the broth.
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
This is your typical wanna be Phoenix version of the Irish Bar.
I can't compare it to the Persian food that I've eaten in Tehran but it was pretty good.
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
Highly recommended.
Good thing I tip in cash and didn't pre-tip... So
Stopped in last night for dinner....around 7ish...so a little busy
Additionally
3 Blind Moose house wine for 3 bucks.
Its right near Chandler High School so it gets really crowded around lunch time M-F.
About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.
I'd do better with the peanuts on the flight.
Do either one of them offer to bring me fresh fluffy eggs?
If anything the meat was slightly on the dry side.
I was puissed because we diddnt have it on us.
:-) If you're coming from the south just turn left on Oakey and then right into the Pizza Hut parking lot
When I asked about some of the dishes
The mushrooms had very good flavor but I would have like more caps than stems.
I've been here twice already and both times I ordered the bento box.
Waitress was a little slow in service.
This place is not worth your time
did not like at all.
The Burrittos Blah!
Pointed to it on the menu.
My friend and I stood between several tables with people at them looking at us looking at them.
Expect a full house
The food
Service is also cute.
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
After complaining and doing an incident report we were moved to a room on the 17th floor.
So they performed.
That's okay though
You get quite friendly with your neighbors
They even have coca-cola in the bottle!
This is NOT an upscale place - they're in a strip mall - and they should be pleased to greet any guest walking through the door.
See ya next time
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
: ) Despite service issues
His attitude is that he doesn't eat decor or tablecloths
#NAME?
This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm
The worst was the salmon sashimi.
I asked for a steak knife - which it should have been served with.
I live in Henderson
I only ate 1 bite
Cheese is good friend of mine.
Also there are combos like a burger
This was like the final blow!
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food
Put out Ranch Dressing or BBQ Sauce in your condiment line-up and I'm even happier.
Overall
She was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.
or something..../) He continued to monitor our table the rest of the evening with a distinct 'Have the complainers left yet?'
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
Went to Cafe Moda to meet up a whole bunch of guy friends at about 2am on a Friday night.
Ample portions and good prices.
Poor service
she may have even rolled her eyes behind her glasses.
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
Service sucks.
The shrimp tender and moist.
Like so many other things in Phoenix/Scottsdale
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
I'd pay money to see one of the Scottsdale nightclub service brats try and keep up with her for a night!
If you look directly in the hall way you should see a TV and a pin ball machine.
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
On a positive note
These are a must try.
This is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.
Frozen pucks of disgust
Spring rolls are delicious but small.
Maybe I'm just fortunate
On the downside the sushi that came off of this menu was unappetizing and the chicken katsu was the best thing I had that day.
My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages.
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
2 - My dad goes here a LOT
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
I came back after a couple of years to get my usual corned beef hash w/ scrambled eggs and hot chocolate.
The burger is good beef
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
He came back and said that the Manager said there wasn't anything she could do since it was a special order anyway.
OR are you a really good place?
Sat down and saw people getting seated that came in after I did.
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty
We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
After spending over 8 years as a server and front of house manager in restaurants I know what to expect and how to treat customers.
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
Alright fine.
There sauces compliment the food
Thanks Cooper!
My brain has exploded with new possibilities.
Their chow mein is so good!
They have horrible attitudes towards customers
The bartender said They are $4 actually... The guy left pissed.
It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items.
The portion was huge!
I'd looked the bar up and their website made it look quite nice inside.
This is a typical waiting for food activity
Then came the piece de resistance that I was waiting for the most: a 12-oz.
I will be ordering this again
Wasn't really happy with that
This is near my work and I drove by it all the time thinking I should go in there.
great food--not the same old
The bass comes with head and bones - accidentally swallowed a small bone
Loved it...friendly servers
If the local schools are out of session
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop
I really want to like this Native New Yorker as it is close to my house.
During my last trip to Las Vegas I stayed at Caesars Place and was excited to have a 24 hour restaurant downstairs.
She eventually had to abandon her drink when it became too sweet to finish-- all the honey she couldn't taste apparently had settled on the bottom.
The ripped banana was not only ripped
The first being the stuffed apple delight.
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
And of course the Market Cheese Board had a MKT price of TWELVE DOLLARS.
They make sure to make them as close to the original in Brooklyn as possible.
Once you get your bite into ANY of their food
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
It may have been the workers that were here this particular day.
We'd definitely go back here again.
You practically had to take the stairs to get to the soup.
Dumbfounded.
Cold brew coffee
PS: The gals get a rose upon entry which you can give to one of the many hobos or unsupervised little kids outside on the FSE.
We are so glad we found this place.
Great food and service
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
I think I spend more time waiting at oreganos than I do dining.
A great way to finish a great.
Last visit had a mix up on my order.
Anyway
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks
My only complaint is could have used more meat to noodle ratio.
hot room
As a side note
The service was meh.
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake
I guess I should have known that this place would suck
It can easily be pushed aside.
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
It was outstanding and well balanced
My friend said Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?
The service was bad but I am glad they had New Castle on tap.
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
I'm not a huge fan of greasy fried food so can't speak for their fish and chips.
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
Brand New location on the perimeter of the Paradise Valley Mall
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
The cream sauce was so bland that I had to dress it up with condiments on the table.
The turkey and roast beef were bland.
First of all
This place has it!
The wings are okay.
My husband doesn't like cilantro so our waitress out the pico de gallo on the side for me.
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
I am excited to see this place make it big
Line was long as usual.
(It was 8pm on a Saturday.)
If I didn't drop a minimum of $20 on every visit they'd definitely get 5 stars.
The food was good
It was completely empty inside but what do you expect for late Sunday lunch time?
On the left side of the restaurant were about 4 bar tables with stools.
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
Only reason why I've been here are those drunken late nights and nothing is open.
The fries were quite tasty though :) For $9 a sandwich
Still the restaurant of choice when my and the girlfriend comes.
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
That cracked me up.
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
Omelets are to die for!
I think management really needs to work on their employees customer service skills.
I could swear my plate was mooing back at me.
We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.
We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m.
The entire restaraunt is open air
It's not on the menu but they have no problem making them.
kind of like and old persons house.
My summers comprise of late nights driving to various places in the city.
I suppose it's my fault for thinking I should try something different from Glass Nickel for a change.
Everything was fresh and delicious!
In summary
They give you as little as possible.
I am such a sucker for Italian!!
Excited for Jane's Addiction and Fishbone next weekend!
The sauce was not in a quantity to make the dish messy and hide the texture of the crêpe.
Like sludge!!!
Like every other place
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth
Patrick holding a pint!
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before
Best breakfast buffet!!!
say bye bye to your tip lady!
I like the feel of that.
We'll never go again.
Will be back again!
They should require some kind of dress code or at least collared shirts and slacks.
Food arrived quickly!
There were more items
It was not good.
On the up side
We got a table in the kitchen and were treated well.
We all agree we would have preferred that.
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow
The only good thing was our waiter
Best Buffet in town
We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero!
Tempe seems to be the edge of our travel for food and drink zone.
When they come back
We shared a Salami Panino (Panini is plural before you criticize....) & also a bowl of the lentil soup.
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction
Definitely not romantic or intimate.
Oh well you don't know until you try right?
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
The food was delicious
We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.
Will go back next trip out.
Sooooo good!!
BBQ bacon cheese burger and chicken wings are excellent.
i was dying of dehydration!
That was a vanilla shake right?
The rolls weren't great but weren't bad.
Well
REAL sushi lovers
It is served as a big chunk rather than thinly sliced.
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving
And finally after he ducks in the back again he came back with the check.
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
He sat there while you took out your crappy life on him.
Too bad the security is lame because they don't let anyone 6 and over ride it.
Nice
PAD THAI: Tiny little noodles and it makes your neighborhood Thai place embarrassed to use ketchup!
No thanks on trying the food here if that's the case.
What I did not realize was that this only covers water.
Good prices.
I'm sorry but if you claim to be such a great coffee shop you should know what the heck you're doing and so should your employees.
If not for the decor
Check it out.
He explained that they've been very busy and therefore had run out of lots of things.
You can play shuffle board
I was in town visiting a friend and he said this was a good local bar where we could have a couple beer and play a game of poker.
Lastly
It was pretty gross!
hot peppers and basil.
HMMM.....just like that relationship
Our salad was good
I've had better atmosphere.
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
On the plus side
No comparison.
I'm sure I would have given them a better score had it not been for the slowness of the waiter checking on us.
We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it.
I do understand that is just what they do but weird.
The country toast was mouth watering.
We had to ask a waiter to pass on the message to our waitress.
The baked ziti
Service is slow
For desert
The decor is just kitchy enough to add to the authenticity without being corny.
Way too sweet... But that seems to be the recurring theme: every single thing on the menu it seems has a sweet flavor.
Apparently it is rocket science to address this.
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place
You have to flag someone down if you want a to go box
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
Worst service to boot
bottom line.
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
They serve the chicken pulled apart
The guys all had steaks
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi
We had the Omikase -- $100 per person -- so it's a bit steep but we thought the quality was way worth it.
Host staff were
Thought I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves with a canoli for dessert.
Which still blows my mind how that can do that because it's all laid down step by step how to make some thing.
We had a great server however the food was not good and we wont be back.
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
Garlic fail number 2.
The pizza looked good
So breakdown: 3 stars = Service from the girls 1 star = Food -2 stars = the cooks not getting the order right
Fish tacos cames with a tiny cup of salsa.
The salt and pepper fried shrimp was small and over-fried.
dirty floors and counters and the pop machine was leaking all over the place.
Phenomenal food
I wouldn't return.
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly
We also bought the homemade english muffins that are huge!
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
Hence my amazement at the tiramisu.
Penne vodka excellent!
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich
The management is rude.
I had dinner with some co-workers here last week.
Now do something about it.
Delicious NYC bagels
V and I ordered cappuccino (Cartel was out of V's favorite chai)
Great Subway
We were on dessert by the time water arrived.
I have never had anything like it.
Definitely not a deal that I could pass up.
I had the Caesar salad that came with my fiance's salmon entree and the appetizer of rolled steak filled with asparagus and cheese.
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
HOW THIS LOCATION SAVED MY WAISTLINE!
WHATS WITH THE CONSTANT ........... Raising the menu prices ?????
It wasn't fun
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
He was extremely rude and really
One think I really liked about this place was the fact we had such good service
There's not much else to say.
Service once seated took a little while as well.
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
Most of it was delicious... they really like pork and salt and sauce.
I tasted the Black Cod and although it was very flavorful
Don't do it!!!!
I had the Cuban pork and it was delicious along with the lemonade and my friend has the Italian sausage which he stated that was good.
Most of the rest seems overly heavy.
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
There were loads of diced tomatoes and onion in there as well.
Our food was served within five minutes.
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
We almost bailed then
Let me first say that i had never before had a bad experience at a Wynn resort.
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
The restaurant was really crowded and small.
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
I will recommend you make reservations and come with a healthy appetite!
The menu is always changing
The service was a little slow
I had heard that Bonsai was one of the better choices in town and after passing on Broughton Street
Usually we don't order the 'Dinner for ___' at Asian restaurants
The calamari looked like scrawny chicken strips and tasted like a flavorless
I give it 2 thumbs down
Our waitress then asked our party if everyone's steak was cooked to their liking but she said it in a tone
Antelope: almost too gamey for my liking
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
)
I definitely recommend this breakfast spot
If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.
Mmm tequila.
It was exactly that.
Wife and I had hors d'oeuvres at the bar.
The owner is nice and
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
Cosmo...weren't you supposed to be different and awe-inspiring?
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
I had the Chicken Chimichanga.
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
I looked past that.
All in all
My fiancé and I were starving.
The new menu still does The waitresses are not carrying 67 guns
... So strange... Even still though
And if you want to know why I'm raving it's because yes they are slow and I'm going to be bummed if they close.
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
Granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.
My bf always gets the miso broth.
We went for hookah and a light meal with low expectations.
this place is good.
The wings were pretty hot for medium
It is Very disappointing that this establishment would turn down customers.
I had the chicken bryan and it was delish as were the garlic mashed potatoes that had the ice cream scoop shape.
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
There was definitely a perceptible difference in service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people.
We had one waiter and it seemed that he had no help for 12 people.
I was seated immediately.
Their menu is diverse
Sitting on the street side patio offers great people watching opportunities.
$9 for potstickers seems a bit much.
I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot!
Way too small for a place like this
Food was ok nothing to brag about.
I do not however go to restaurants solely to be treated nicely but instead I go for the food.
Avoid at all cost!
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
DELICIOUS!!
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
My girlfriend said she would prefer a place with more of an atmosphere.
As a third generation hillbilly once removed
We waited for about an hour and a half for our tables
When I asked how the person that just came got a table
Just wish it wasn't in Henderson.
I've never been treated so bad.
Did I just visit on an off day or did the all-you-can eat menu change the way these previously delicious dishes were prepared?
Bacon is hella salty.
Despite the above I am not a complainer as I look forward to time out with my friends
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
It all got sorted out but shouldn't have happened in the first place.
I concurred
*FRIED PICKLES* I've loved everything i've had so far...just wish the food came out faster :)
Where do I start?
They were closer in texture to spaghetti.
Requirement 2 - relishes PASS - Tornado serves proper relishes (carrots
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be
When they finally did bring out the food
The waitresses are very friendly.
Hungry barefooted girls in line and drunk guys talking to themselves.
Lordy
About 5 minutes later someone else brought us our entrees.
the meat wasn't bad
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
Naan: A little bit too much cilantro
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews
I wasn't disappointed.
So we rushed through our food and got outta there since they did not want us to linger.
Seasoning of the gravy was pretty good
We sat in the dining room and looked over the menu.
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
Wish we hadn't.
I'm a fan of Hubert from TV.
I'm not too big of a fan of Crabs.
Where's the dark rum?
If you're staying at Caesars Palace
Here's the deal.
I should have gotten a slice of pizza because the wait was killing me.
Overall I'd say they are right between Meh and Good.
Went here based off yelp reviews and it was delicious!
When we asked the food runner about it
If I'm with someone
It was still delicious and this time I had sampled the banana and pumpkin bread.
This is the first and definitely the last time I will visit this buffet.
In the sitting area they have a huge loveseat that is broke down needs to be taken to the dump with it's caved in seating and filthy cloth.
The atmosphere is modern and hip
Not a weekly haunt
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either.
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland
Expect the price here to be a buck or two more than the truck is on the regular.
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
It's not hard to get this wrong.
We also ordered sides of mushrooms
*MOUTH DROOLS* The lady up front is very nice too and I liked that they had tables outside!
This could possibly make you skip back to my car after having one or two or three!
He really is a great people-person.
For dinner they include two different sashimi orders on their All You Can Eat menu.
All that said 3 of us was $ 130.00 of utter slop.
The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.
Is it part of the French attitude?
Discuss.....
The server greeted us at our table with a fresh house made bread selection of onion
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
It was probably dirt.
We had rush though our meal
But this drink... Oh man.
I do not think that the management ever eats there
He said the burger was huge....It wasn't
Then we walked inside... Flies!
Love this place
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
If you're considering going to Masto's
The food sucked
Interesting decor.
So
What I really like there is the crepe station.
i had the gnocchi and my husband had the scallops.
Also were served hot bread and butter
I used to work nearby
The only major con was that there was only one lady and one little counter.
But
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)
They do need to space out the servings though.
If a restaurant lets me order it
At a $65 price tag for the tasting menu for dinner - it's a steal really!
I told her we only ordered 2 dishes and that they had made a mistake.
Pricey lunch but we ordered too much.
And he took the plate without saying anything.
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
When my order arrived
Buffalo Wings or Wads?
We asked if there was a Thai chef and were told to order a Thai dish and judge for ourselves (ie no).
I had a salad with the wings
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
oh oh oh It's worth a go-oh!
The food: We went around 6:00 on a Friday and they were out of chicken and ribs.
The Server again spoke with the Manager about our decision to leave.
The first time
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
Every table to our right
Bonus points for the old-timey neon out front.
The live music on Fridays totally blows.
However
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
1 time what we ordered and what we got were not even close.
Very friendly staff.
I came here for some french fries
Chelsea's emailed me after my first review and asked for additional feedback.
It is worth the drive.
I had heard good things about this place
Food was great and so was the serivce!
We all ordered our pies a la mode.
The warm beer didn't help.
Great brunch spot.
Service is friendly and inviting.
Very good lunch spot.
My husband ordered the trout (not something that he would usually order but wanted something different)
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
That was fine by us.
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
BUT if you keep your eyes out
I didn't mention this before
Portions are quite large...my bento had several moist pieces of salmon teriyaki
Must have been an off night at this place.
An inviting place
The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms
The inside looks like a countrified
We'll he doubled check and it was the replacement for the one on the current list
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure
No one checked on us for refills or if we needed anything.
For about 10 minutes
Although they did offer after awhile of seein my daughters mouth on fire to tame them down.
The food was pretty decent
Hopnot IPA is a really good IPA Peach Ale is good for a sweeter beer or female
Be warned these noodles are slurpy and you will get the collagen rich stock all over your clothes if you're not careful.
My friend loved the salmon tartar.
*It appears as if Yama is expanding
Won't go back.
Extremely Tasty!
That's right: no ketchup
They do not overload the sushi with rice like many other AYCE places do.
Waitress was good though!
Restaurant accepts cash
My favorite is butterscotch.
good salsa mild and hot chips are good
Soggy and not good.
Both times I have been so far has been on a weekend for late lunch.
I'm not sure if it's more restaurant
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
Which are small and not worth the price.
This bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of Sushi.
#NAME?
Ok
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse
The service was a bit lacking.
Lobster Bisque
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
It was either too cold
We came here for our parting meal... a bit of a brunch
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
So for 2 people without a significant amount of food or drinks we ended up paying over 1$$ which is ridiculous for a pub.
This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
Also there's not outdoor patio
One of the best things about this place is the friendly
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.
As for the mains
Came here and sat down right away.
Patrick's Day in 2009.
Ended up costing around $50 including tax and tip.
The crepes were pretty good so I put up with the treatment for about five visits.
The 1-thing?
I didn't like the clam steamer flavor
I responded with why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?
I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
If the food isn't bad enough for you
Very very fun chef.
You are already getting your meal comped!
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
If it were possible to give them zero stars
The descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce
I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly
The mozzarella was extremely fresh but it was overwhelming with all the tomatoes in it.
All tables occupied
It's nothing fancy
And unfortunately
I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way.
Of course
It was a chicken stew flavored with walnuts and pomegranate.
Hmm
The sea bass that my dad had was flavorful
The owner said he didn't know.
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
I mean
Plenty of TVs inside will make this a great place to be for games
about another 10 - 15 minutes passed before we got our nachos.
Everyone is very attentive
Now that we found the wine club I may be here quite a bit more often.
Julie and Mike were super nice and made my girlfriend and I feel welcome on our first visit to Mr Mama's.
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
I thought I would try serendipity for dessert since it is quite popular and the idea of a frozen hot chocolate is interesting.
Even on a Sunday night
Now this dish was quite flavourful.
The whole thing was smothered in cheese that could have stood to be melted a little more.
When I read about this sandwich on-line it said it had crispy tofu strips
Coming in
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
(It wasn't busy either) Also
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
Frankly
I'll admit
I Yelp Wendy's and find this one is one just around the corner from where I'm staying.
Seriously flavorful delights
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.
We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends.
Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
We were attending a matinee at the symphony and arrived 1.5 hours before and went to the restaurant
I had the Hunan Chicken and an Egg Roll.
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
There were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant.
Owner's are really great people.!
They have a band that plays and a DJ to play when the band is taking a break.
We ordered the octopus sushi and the octopus is no longer in it's fresh pink-red color and has been turned into gray.
Now
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
We then ordered 3 dishes
Salad...The caesar salad was tasty in the end
The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
The only good part of the breakfast was the bacon.
Cute decor
I am sory Surang's Thai
Overall
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
I feel like this is a less well-know restaurant
The mac and cheese was average.
I had the Rib Plate
On top of that the sushi chef gave my family a dirty look for voicing our concerns with the food.
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
We went here for my birthday during Restaurant Week.
Plus I got two ice creams.
Boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich ($5.25) and yam chips($1.99)
Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken.
On to the food stuff... Our party of 8 ordered two bowls of chips to start the evening...at $5.95 a bowl!
I always enjoy a sqaure deal
I eventually received coffee refills after throwing dirty looks at the young waitress who brags about also working at the Hard Rock steakhouse.
Fantastic service here.
I called and bring it to their manager's attention.
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
The salmon sushi and sashimi were VERY good although portions were small.
They know how to make them here.
very tough and very short on flavor!
First with the good.
Entrees: Dover sole - covered in dry
This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle.
I hope this place sticks around.
Plus affordable prices?
We paid for our food and got it to go and ended up giving it to a homeless guy on mill.
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
It wasn't even during peak hours
They didn't even have to make anything for me.
No room for dessert.
I've been here many times as it is right down the road from my neighborhood.
Can't wait!
But this place is just not good any more.
Good service
Decent casual atmosphere.
In the past I have been treated well and with respect.
And don't say restaurant Mexico!
I'll say this... they should seriously consider selling the chili as a chili bowl separate.
Just bam
By the power of Yelp
- Sexy cocktails - Fabulous ambiance Cons: - My trout had too much lemon and I was too drunk to have the presence of mind to send it back.
The servers are friendly
Both were great.
The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
Wildfish is right off of Camelback Rd
For the discerning beef eater
Plus
We ordered a fillet of steak
We were not happy
The service was not up to par
Thus far
The packaging needs improvement.
No complaints about the service
Good luck having a conversation at a normal level.
The food was good but not enough for me to go back again.
They obviously did the restaurant.com deals to drum up business (it was nearly empty in there) and that is how they treat us?
Both rolls tasted very 'fishy' which should never be the case.
Guacamole came out with the meal- blamed on kitchen for the mistake.
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe
)
when we pointed this out to the waitress she did not seem surprised at all
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
Food was good
The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away.
I settled for an FP 8th street Ale.
The remodel looks like it's going to be very schwanky too once it's complete in November.
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
It was very noisy but aesthetically pleasing.
Kevin O'Donnell is from the Texas Hold'em family of final tables and occasionally will play the tour.
You can't beat that.
I'm not the douchebag here
Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman
The good food is gone.
The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
We go to the Earl and get our sandwiches
If you've got the budget to blow and want a smart
I've had better
I guess it just wasn't for me.
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
I think not again
I would have rather had Golden Corral.
Since there were several of us dining that evening
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
I'm allergic to onion.
The dip was spinachy enough
But whatevs
How on earth can you screw up a pulled pork sandwich-twice!
as I always do
They took the bags away
The Reuben sandwich lunch was half that.
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
Service stinks here!
That is the Welcome Diner.
Well I'll say one thing from the get go
Drive somewhere else vs.
I waited and waited.
The lunch was unexpectedly rushed due largely to my inability to find a parking spot (oops!)
The Grilled Chicken was kind of bland in my opinion.
Anyone wanna buy it?
This place is not quality sushi
first
My brother was ecstatic as can be when he first took a bite of this shaved ice.
Bathrooms are forever away
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
Great Pizza and Salads!
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
This place is amazing!
The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty!
Our group went with the seafood combination
This is the second time in 2 months this has happened on different days.
The dates were sweet and melted in your mouth
You get the point.
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
Just don't know why they were so slow.
*Gave them two hours advance notice we had a party of 20
They are worth the $$.
What's all the hype?
The Garlic Garlic Shrimp had 9 good sized shrimp with the tails on served on a bed of raw cabbage.
The upkeep of the interior could use some work.
I initially said I wanted to get the all you can eat and then asked leaned that most of what I wanted to order was on the a la cart menu.
Alberto was fun and made great martinis.
The staff is great
It was tasty but not outstanding.
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here
I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
You get incredibly fresh fish
So I was totally worried that Lolo's wouldn't live up to the hype.
It has all the ingredients but comes up short time and again.
It was initially served in one dish
The pretentious menu
If you get the chance to have Albert wait on you
Seat promptly - then waited.
(: Ordered the quesadilla appetizer.
It was still breakfast time according to their posted menu (till 11 a.m.).
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside
I went here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything went pretty smoothly considering our group's size.
Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.
You have to eat here when you have time late at night and are craving some Japanese flair.
I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
The omelettes look more like accidents than exquisitely prepared dishes.
When I go to the one in central Phoenix they have my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink.
Never again will I be dining at this place!
The food was excellent and service was very good.
Pity that I overlooked that when it mattered!
It's hard to find Chinese food cooked for Chinese and not the american palette.
But fret not
A manager came up and yelled at the poor hostess in front of us.
They're busy at lunchtime.
The food is okay
A total of 8 orders for two people came to a little more than $17.
Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
I will DEFINITELY come here again.
Lobster was like rubber) For such and expensive dish
No waiting at this McDonalds.
The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy.
She didn't try to sell us anything
We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.
If you don't know what you like- you can grab a slice of every meat to sample
A manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu.
We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street.
People seem to love this place
Beware!!!!!!
It was a little expensive but what do you expect for a steak house in Vegas.
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
You can't fake happy for that long!
This is my go-to Chinese place.
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
I like this new location compared to the old one BC parking is convenient and the restaurant is larger but still quaint.
Food was really boring.
Good Service-check!
I don't think it would have been a big deal to throw some veg into the juicer
The salad was a handful of greens a pinch of cuc's and tomatoes.
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
I've been to numerous steak houses throughout the country and not one comes close!!
Will never
As much as I'd like to go back
Then I proceeded to order the Duck Lo Mein.
Service was also commendable.
The food is good so the fun vibe is just icing.
I like the vegetarian cheese burger but I don't eat cheese so I ask for it without the cheese.
Every time we go to Vegas
In the summer
We waited another 20 minutes before being seated.
I did not expect this to be so good!
Fantastic food!
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
The Big Apple now serves breakfast all day long
They discounted our food
The food was very good.
I can't say enough about the great personalized service from the food runners and hosts to the servers and management.
Yet
They started learning our names.
Went for lunch and ordered the lunch special sweet and sour pork
My only complaint would be that the melon that came on the side was a big slice that still had the rind on it.
I've seen food we ordered given away right in front of me
I was starving and i wasn't craving anything while i was walking down Downtown Las Vegas.
Anyways
Never going back.
There's no doubt they're busy
I went there with three of my coworkers while we were in Las Vegas.
Great food for the price
before any waiters acknowledged us.
We got a Voucher to the buffet
I was injured walking into Calico Jack's because of their negligence.
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
We also shared the Local Roasted Cauliflower.
My only issue was a small one.
By this point
I promptly
Back to good BBQ
Haven't been here since they've changed management.
And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20
I was honestly more excited about drinks and dessert
They came with chorizo which was minced and sprinkled over the mussels.
The chicken madras
This plate is so big you can easily split it w someone.
So I ordered a regular ketchup and all I could say think was I want some Heinz dangit!
We got there about 7PM on a Friday night... and the place was really dead.
I'm not sure if it's even open for business.
All the bread is made in-house!
The only downside is the service.
Also
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.
A couple of months later
I usually order take out from here when we are not in the mood to cook dinner.
There's a huge menu of hot drinks
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
It was a lovely meal
Don't get me wrong
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
They also agreed to some of my special requests... so.
We've had China Mama on our list for a few months and finally made it over there last week.
When it initially opened I gave it three stars.
Very similar to Ted's in Tempe.
The Bun Rieu is in the $9.00 range but the flavor and ingredients are top notch.
The standouts for us were the Monkey Cakes which were very nicely cooked pancakes with bananas and slivered almonds in the batter
You won't be disappointed.
They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast
All no dairy or chicken broth used
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders
I love coming here for a late night snack... carna asada flatbread & a stella~!I love the Western theme...they didsuch a good job!
The blueberry muffin I had to go with it didn't hurt my feelings either.
I just wish they would open a place near the Biltmore where I live.
Both of them were truly unbelievably good
We had fantastic service
What deserves 3-4 stars: - The frites and classic mayo dipping sauce are absolutely delicious.
Drive out of your way to find a Long John Silvers you will be way better off.
However
I'll save my Omakase dollars for Austin's Uchi.
They run around looking so busy.. But I seriously don't see them doing anything.. And the food here is just plain horrible!
No wonder this place is always packed
Everything was gross.
There were plenty of open table.
I love this place.
Great service and food.
And even though I'm close to senility
Drop the prices to $5 and at least get some cash flow going and people in the doors
Maybe we resembled someone he hated.
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
Ok
The burger... I got the Gold Standard a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.
This is a real Hash House with several different kinds of hash!!
OMG
And Urban Spoon- get busy!
In regards to the meat
Even when we were completely come eating we could not find her.
There is nothing authentic about this place.
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
Of all the dishes
PS - Try a sandwich on the house-made bread they have.
I finally noticed a guy sitting inside.
Since we were in Vegas
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
Florindinos is more authentic
The food itself was fine
It's worth driving up from Tucson!
Ordered a wine and beer and an antipasti plate.
My wife and I had heard about this place and about their happy hour (Revive @ 5) menu.
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
Pretty good beer selection too.
There are not a ton of selections
This place is like Chipotle
Classy/warm atmosphere
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
It might have been a one time thing
I have eaten here multiple times
Sausage was gross
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
I have to admit
I thought there wasn't enough sauce
After the meal we let Travis know again that we would like a box for the pot stickers and that we still NEVER got our spring rolls.
The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier
I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal.
He was terrible!
Everyone is treated equally special.
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
It was delicious!!!
Not at all what I have come to expect from this place.
On the good side
The only one who ate the food was my husband
So I was under the impression that when you use the urinal
Extra sour cream
The grilled octopus with broccoli raabi was tasty and nicely cooked
My ex is more familiar with japanese dishes so I let her do the ordering and I do the eating.
I learned the building was originally a department store.
Sadly
Next stop was the carving line.
T was smiling the whole time while eating it
Had a better 6.00 dollar burger at a famous fast food chain.
2) The food cannot really be called that.
We've been coming here since '07.
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
I had to dissect my wrap in order to remove bits of bacon and could taste it in every bite.
Best fish I've ever had in my life!
I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.
The highlight of the experience was the Michelada I ordered with Modelo Especial which was made perfectly.
I tried this place based on a recommendation of a co-worker.
After much hype about the lobster club
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
We won't be returning
Apparently they have a HUGE soccer following..we were there in January.
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
I must say that Walking Stick Resort and Casino is truly impressive and Wandering Horse is definitely deserving of its place here.
Dont understand the rating food was very average.
Make a reservation!
This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
This round was by far the best part of our visit to this establishment.
The free pops were also appreciated.
Pretty cool I would say.
$8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts
My favorite was always Wednesday night soup with their Chicken Enchilada Soup
Amazing food
I drank 3 bottles of it..... in 2 hours.
Lon's is not a bad restaurant....its simply not the excellent gem it once was :( 1) Only 1 chocolate dish on the dessert menu.
But not today.
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
At this point we had a long day and were over the experience.
I won't avoid this place for a normal dining experience based on today
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
We ordered the plantain spring rolls with mango chutney.
We did find out they have loaner sport coats
DJ points to his screen.
I find wasting food to be despicable
And compared to the SF restaurant
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
Even though that is the correct portion size
Service was nice but not particularly warm or anything.
Well after being out of the country for quite some time
So
Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
Green's success lies in the adage that some people will eat ANYTHING.
Instead it's quite light
Came here after watching O just down the hall and all I can say is WOW (to Fix
The staff are great
Looking around
All night
In fact
He deserves 5 stars.
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
I was floored at the bad reviews when I truly thought it was delicious.
Did we get a lot of chips?
We ordered the Calamari for an appetizer and my boys loved it.
Pulled pork sliders.
They dropped more than the ball.
The dining space is tiny
By the time we got out of there it was almost 11:00 and the mall the restaurant is located in was closed.
They will customize your order any way you'd like
Scenery isn't much to look at
Less hassle for us and more time to have a chat.
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
We decided to go with the ahi tuna appetizer.
I usually don't write about chains unless I feel really strongly about it.
I'll stick to five guys.
Best tacos in town by far!!
I took back my money and got outta there.
In an interesting part of town
Drink though can get a bit pricy.
She finally waved down the other bartender
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
So when I ran my card I was pretty baffled that meal totaled over $15 bucks!
My favorite would be the brisket
The staff are now not as friendly
Pretty decent for a small coffeehouse/eatery.
I won't be back.
They have great dinners.
Nearly everything that came out was drenched in citrus
This was my first time eating here (March 10
The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.
Went to kitchen to inspect pizza.
TGI Friday's?
The food was terrible.
They were so quick to drop the check off.
Steamed Chicken - We asked for the chilled version
Not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but a great experience nonetheless.
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
I also snuck in some creamed spinach on the side
The Teppan Yaki with the owner is FANTASTIC.
We ordered about 12 pieces.
I opted for the sausage/pepperoni slice.
The cheese puffers they bring in the beginning are delectable and a perfect introduction to the food.
Please send me back!
Some kind of yellow tail sushi roll - (2 stars).
Most likely not.
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
The food was amazing
For $12 dollars it's a lot of food.
All I can say about this is the food is mediocre
It's a sandwich
Food: portions are big (again
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
I went for lunch.
The wait time between courses was not paced weil.
Keeps shit edgy.
If you go
You know it's a good thing when there's a lineup
Sit down and wait 10mins for server or anyone to approach us.
Never had a heard a good thing about this place
Our server seemed very rushed and distracted
Sitting outdoors under the string lights and German beer flags just made you thirsty for beer!
This is a disgrace.
Def coming back to bowl next time
If you want a great steakhouse which is worth it's weight in gold
The 3rd member of our party did throughly enjoy his short ribs.
We only oder 4 waters and a small sake for myself.
We also planm to let everyone we know about this.
If you want healthy authentic or ethic food
I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;
I didn't have high expectations to start with being in an airport and all.
He came back and said that the pad Thai was for the other table
Though it's still pricey
I have been here several times in the past
Unfortunately there was a serious language barrier so I'm not sure he understood what had happened other than a customer was majorly pissed.
Of course we tip at any restaurant
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total.
For starters
Acting all haughty.
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
This should have been a warning of how things were to be... The second time
To summarize... the food was incredible
Arrived on a Sunday around 12:15pm and it took less than 5 minutes to get in through the Invited Guests line.
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
As soon as we were settled chips
We liked that the bar was separate from the restaurant and that we could hear ourselves talk.
SERVICE: 0/5 Hated it
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.
I saw someone uploaded a picture of their Burglary sign in August but this was definitely not the same sign.
Your won't miss me
Drink menu was on an iPad
I had the Huaraches.
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
It was like porn to me.
So the method is if you see something interesting on the menu order it
I had to check out the place since it looked like a classic taco shack you'd find in Mexico.
It was the most dry and chewy steak I ever ate.
This one is simply a disappointment.
How about leave a bottle of sriracha out like any other restaurant?
I like Le Village Buffet.
Overall
We had actually had arepas before
And they never do.
I firmly believe this is a manager's job and should be done everywhere.
A fun outing he and his family never tired of were trips to Rawhide.
Eerder een zeer teleurstellende ervaring gehad.
The only reason I'm not giving this rating 5 stars is because the size of the bathroom and the nosies the toilet made once it was flushed.
When we walked in they knew who we were
would i come back?
I finished my two tacos and was sad that they were over.
First
Saffron Flavors of India is a rarity because so few Indian restaurants are located in Northwest Las Vegas.
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
Quiznos is Quiznos as another reviewer said.
The food is typical bar food
Great place to eat
If i would have known they were hosting the fight and charging
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
Left very frustrated.
I'll definitely be in soon again.
See my list of Phoenix's best burgers.
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
Service was fantastic.
We've been going to Yvonne's for years now and it used to be great.
This was my first experience eating Ethiopian food.
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
So I ordered two tacos with potatoes
You know
Went to Marcellino with a large dinging group (about 18 people).
YES PLEASE!
How effed up is that???
To start with the almond type butter in the bread basket.
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
Come hungry
I believe the next thing was an Alaskan roll
No thank you Oregano's
And the food at Macayo's is none of those.
For service
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
The dish came with most of the traditional garnishes for com tam
i've stayed at better hotels in the middle of nowhere...where was our coffee maker?
And to top off the experience when I was there Rick Moonen
The menu is huge
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
Well
Spent several nights in this place.
I was told once
An aside: The view is freaking ridiculous.
But now I was completely grossed out.
famous for their 24 hour specials.
But pass on the cheese board... 3 small slices for $14.
Some must like it the other way around.
These people
First of all
I felt like a fish out of water here (haha get it?)
While Voila has only been open for four months
Open 24/7.. but you can only get breakfast certain hours.
I say I would like both since you are out of the taters.
The hostess was out.
Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special.
I read that this place has one of the best mac-n-cheese recipes in two
Been to many Brazilian Steakhouse
I really enjoyed eating here.
First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
By the time we'd devoured the 3 dogs
Our server was very nice
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
A typical buffet.
On the ground
The restaurant was open and bright and coming in from triple digit heat
My second visit was for happy hour
I had a peach carbonated soda that was really good to and not too sweet.
I came after Christmas and the restaurant is half-opened.
The regular fries are limp and bland
The hostess was polite and friendly and the place looked great on first glance
They aren't anything like knots.
A friend and I went here yesterday for lunch and we both got screwed on the price and change.
Furthermore
Because you people do not care !
I had a reasonable amount of dinner and one cosmopolitan.
Sat for over 45 minutes after placing our order without food or drink refills.
I highly
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
Very mixed feelings here.... the sushi is great....VERY tasty.
Management at the Hotel was also condescending and of no help whatsoever.
It was really good
Other notable mentions are the Arcadia Club
Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over.
What a mistake that was!
No complaints!
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.
I had to throw the lemon aid out after one sip there was something seriously wrong with it.
America
But hey
Waiter was a jerk.
She loved it but has had better.
Good for lunch combos - that's about it.
Strike 2
Looking forward to some original chicken
Had another delicious meal here again.
The food was good but not great and not what I expected from two Top Chef Masters.
We entered on a Saturday just before 6pm.
So busy in fact
Try Feast Buffet at Red Rock.
Sorry Bollywood
Sure it's a little better than Elis Island but it's 8 Times more money!
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
I will eat at the same five restaurants for months because I know there is something on the menu I can eat
They acknowledged our gift card
I never come again.
Had my first fish taco but most important they sell roger's mexican mooon shine.
It's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff
We took a seat out front which was nice and had a view of the bar.
You wont find me driving out of my way to try it again though :(
But the waiters must have been recruited from Applebees!
We loved the biscuits!!!
No mention of the half of the drink order that we had to ask someone else for.
80s music played along with their music videos on one wall.
The flavor would've been pretty good if they hadn't put so many crunchy noodles in it.
Kids eat free on Tuesday!
I drive up to the window and they tell me they are out of beef!?
Double double
As they say here
So we were looking for something different in Tempe.
Service is quick and friendly.
Then for the main course
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
So absolutley fantastic.
Not that I had a hangover.
My husband thought that they could take some of the tables out and have it a little more roomy
The LV Central occupies a nice looking space near the entrance across from the reception desk.
Can we say very limited menu?
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
I thought I was going to a seafood joint.
definitely will come back here again.
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
I got the Prime Rib sandwich and it was incredibly small.
Wow very spicy but delicious.
What I got at Le Provencal was faux Italian food that was neither tasty nor special.
If you're not familiar
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
The only good thing about this place is the location.
A salmon roll with avocado; this was a specialty order they had no trouble making for us.
I'd love to go back.
Lol I guess... On my second visit I decided to give this place another shot.
Anyway
Cool bar
I'll be back for the home of the crown jewel of sandwiches!
now if we didnt have places to be we would have gone inside and ordered our food and waited.
We had the sliders
This is a five star Pei Wei
Use to love this place... Service and food have gone downhill
Nothing special.
Guess I will have to go again so I can give you more specifics.
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!
Not to mention the combination of pears
Sauces were a major issue.
I was filled up
the nachos were good and mama tolerated her salad.
Will not be back.
From the beginning our waitor was very high strung and kept talking over me when I was asking him questions.
Sauce was tasteless.
The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.
The food is delicious and just spicy enough
Lychee was refreshing and with the bite of smooth
You figured theyd bring this stuff out as a courtesy.
My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
Surly old lady working the counter on my day and believe me
We also ordered fried calamari.
We got Pork Pad Thai- spice level 4 no complaints here
Food was so gooodd.
Came with mashed.
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
When I first walked in
Will stick with the ol standby
Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on
I was so insulted.
@ Sesame Balls - Oily
If you are going to serve a rolled taco
The green tea isn't that great
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
We were with a large group and we ordered wine for the whole table
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
The atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.
on Stephanie.
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful
If there's any kind of a wait
Anyway
Nargile - I think you are great.
Best tater tots in the southwest.
Non problem I say and that's when the wait started There was one car in front of me at the window and the car was off.
We loved the place.
It has Skyy citrus vodka
Little dishes for sharing.
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
Been here 5 times and am now leaving a review because I feel that they deserve a shout out!
When I arrived
If you're comfortable in this yuppie type of environment you'll more than likely enjoy it.
She asked us if we wanted to sit in the lounge but I can assure you my 90 year old grandmother would rather sit down where we're eating.
I got the Fish and Chips and won't be getting it again.
It appeared no one has wiped down the area in years.
The extra grilled jalapeño peppers are Delish.
The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
i did forget the mention that when they would put down a plate it was like they were intentionally banging the plates on the table.
I may disappoint some with this review because I ordered something very basic for brunch.
Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
cool paintings on the wall and very small and only a few tables available.
So I had to pay the all you can eat price plus everything else I wanted to order.
The manager was the worst.
I have been here 2 times now
We were told we were being upgraded complimentary to a King Suite.
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
The service is great; they really pay attention to your grills to make sure to clean your grill out from time to time.
Not to mention
Slow service with an impatient waitress
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
The crust was amazingly crusty.
Why would you staff this place with 5 people when it clearly needs more?
Appears to be family owned.
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged
Love how this place is 24hours too - perfect for loading up on the carbs after a night of drinking at V Bar and Tao!
Young female waitress was lost.
I'm torn between one and two stars here so will give them the benefit of the doubt.
Love the margaritas
Eggs by Hickman's
We have come here for dinner in the past and for the most part have been relatively satisfied with the food.
I wanted some pancakes and heard this is the place to go.
we came by for lunch after checking out.
All of this was great and the husband even ate the vegetables!
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
Very good
There are different flavored aiolis if you are eating plain fries instead of chili cheese ones.
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
The food is just what you would expect from McDonalds.
Great pork sandwich.
Nope- it came with one small wedge of pineapple ( not sweet)
Not sure how the person above me checked in on 9/23 but this location is closed.
My friend had the Ethiopian wine which had a smell that I wasn't use to
Don't waste your time here.
At 11:30 on a Saturday
We decided to eat the side pieces of the meat and avoid the rare parts..the ribeye was actually a good piece of meat
Total letdown
We only ate there
Third
First of all
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
I wound up getting a Pinalada smoothie and quite frankly I make way better smoothies in my blender at home.
I read these reviews and went anyway since I had a restaurant.com coupon.
The staff are the stars because they provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for your meal
That might've been it actually.
The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
So I forgot a zip lock bag full of hygiene stuff.
I might just have to eat there for lunch tomorrow before I leave.
I am a firm believer that one review or one bad day should be the only thing to base the value of a venue on.
Not so great on refilling our drinks or clearing our plates/finished appetizer basket.
There are also vegetarian and vegan options for everything on the menu.
On some occasion especially when they are busy
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
That said
I also love the sandwiches
When we pulled it it looks like some crummy hole in the wall pizza place.
The only reason someone should ever go is for the entertainment factor Dick's is famous for.
Fourth
Would I go there again?
I had a buddy of mine pick it up for me.
If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi
I LOVED it!
Second time there on Tuesday night.
They didn't know what butter pecan ice cream was.
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
There is an occasional line (confirmation of good food) but the wait is never that long.
Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle
Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames
last night my friend picked up some pies from this place and we inhaled them in just a few minutes (3) pizzas for 8 dudes....took us about 7 minutes.
This place is a jewel in Las Vegas
It isn't really worth while but the food is really delicious.
This particular location in Tempe being connected to a Cinnabon is like a wonderful mix of greatness.
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
The selection of food was not the best.
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
I walked in around 4 on a Saturday
So we knew we had to go.
The fry on the bird was good
it even left me with a stomach ache the rest of the evening.
This isn't a small family restaurant
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
It was attached to a gas station
How awesome is that.
I will be back many times soon.
In fact he was very well spoken and seemed at home in both Spanish and English.
I got the chicken katsu bento box which didn't look like much
I ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp.
When we order she also ask us lunch or dinner portions but completely left out what the difference was.
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
THATS NOT PORK!!
Worse of all
Happy Hour is awesome and the Cucumber Martini is terrific!
When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.
I've had pasta salads from supermarkets
This is not your regular DIVEY Vietnamese joint.
The screaming orgasm was decent.
I've been craving a Taiwanese beef roll since getting back from LA.
We walked in at 8
This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza.
It wasn't all out.
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
He was a cool dude from the local Chevy dealership that came to pick me up to get my car.
And then tragedy struck.
I'm prejudice against chains already but I just don't understand how this place stays busy.
No arguments there.
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
This was my first crawfish experience
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
So my boyfriend goes to talk to the manager and he said the same thing.
Shouldn't you know the dishes?
Where did the taste go.
after sitting for about 10 min someone finally came around and brought us menus and took our drink order.
Sorry for short review
Also
Waitress was sweet and funny.
#NAME?
I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing
Was in our faces for no reason and we just left.
Vegetarian fast food options are limited.
First
We got the rebel special and the banana with nutella (I can't remember the name).
As of the writing of this article
I'd rather eat airline food
The 3rd time I went in after I realized I was going to get sick
Cant say enough good things about this place.
The ambiance was incredible.
The staff was pretty stingy with the vegetables too.
Super disappointed with a recent experience to Bouchon Bakery.
They have a bunch of gigantically garish pillars of flame.
For the price I don't even think I would be back.
Nothing amazing here.
Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.
So all you aspiring Mesa Grill patrons
The waitress and manager are so friendly.
Of course he was
Only food here though.
The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats
And of course overpriced for the quality and quantity of good though reasonably prices compared to the other Bellagio restaurants.
I do think it was a tad over cooked but completely bearable.
I would not recommend this place.
My sauce tasted like it was chef boyardee canned sauce.
#ERROR!
If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me.
The restaurant is usual busy because they give out so many food comps.
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
I don't know if I should give them a second chance or go somewhere where else where they want my money.
My gyro was basically lettuce only.
The waitress said that they didn't have any.
ordered a spicy shrimp dish.
Terrible service!
I stopped in to get a quickie lunch and it was.
We also ordered the jumbo sea scallops with edamame succotash.
Thoroughly disappointed!
The servers were cool
There is a children's menu and non-seafood choices on the regular menu.
I said I dont want hot tomatoes and melted cheese He said Oh and rolled his eyes.
I don't each much pasta
We started the meal with a traditional chips and salsa
The place was relatively packed for an east valley restaurant at almost 11pm.
I got a flatbread pizza that makes TV dinners seem amazing.
Give it a try
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
Boy
Highly recommend for the gfree people out there!
Reasonably priced also!
Given the other reviews it might be worth giving them a second chance.
Everything was perfect the night we were in.
There are Cheesesteaks
That said
I could see the chef cook from where I was sitting.
The food is very good for your typical bar food.
The Eggs Benedict looks like it's mocking you.
Okay so I have been on a crazy ramen kick these last few weeks.
Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?
I really enjoy eating at this place.. the food is always good and the wait staff feels more like family.
I went in Saturday afternoon and it was packed.
Nearly the entire time.
I was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger.
She said something then I ordered too based off what I saw on the machines
Sure beats the Pho spot I was contemplating inside T.I.
Wow after having a LONG night of boozing and partying with the girls we stopped in for lunch before we got back to reality.
Portion size is on the smaller side.
A truly caring owner.
it was a drive to get there.
I did some research and booked a reservation.
They also let go the best servers which really made the place so welcoming and Homey
I was with a good friend who I wanted to catch up with so we didn't care and it didn't seems like it made anyone get out of line and leave either.
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance
The entree was the FIlet Mignon & North Atlantic Lobster Tail.
To give them the benefit of the doubt
Anyway
Point your finger at any item on the menu
They definately added to the experience.
-have you not noticed!!)
And again the franchise opened another location in Las Vegas.
So sour it made my face pucker.
A group of us went here for dinner here last week.
Oh this is such a thing of beauty
If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
It was faster than McDonalds.
Roaring Fork is running their happy hour from 4 - 10 p.m.
A greasy
Since it was happy hour
If the sight of seeing children running around having fun will send you into a tizzy
I tried one of the cherry tomatoes from his dish and though it was a little spicier than mine it wasn't overwhelming.
More of cheese and egg whites.
My advice
My wife ordered the 7oz filet.
The onion rings and frozen hot chocolate was probably the only two things that really stood out to us.
i didn't know that!
first time there and might just be the last.
the dressing tasted like it came with a kids meal at MacDonald s. What a let down.
Later
All I remember was lots of patchouli and eating banana chips.
When they head we were planning a trip to Thailand
So put on your big girl pants
I was tempted to count them but the smell of my meal to be was overwhelming so I ate instead.
You will get better service at home and the decor has to be more attractive.
We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night.
Those burgers were amazing.
Similarly
It usually takes well over an hour for all of this.
Our last dinner there was for New Year's eve 2009.
The dish was dry and served on a hot plate on a bed of chopped onions.
I should've known better since I live in las vegas.
And it was way to expensive.
I was absolutely in love after the first bite and it just got better and better as I ate.
Be sure to order dessert
It was
They were perfectly crisp and soft at the same time.
then she asked me if i spoke spanish
This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
The bartender was also nice.
The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without.
His response was what about MacAyo's?
Usually places deep fry the wings.
Maybe if you combined the mushrooms from both of them you could've actually had enough for one.
I've had much better sushi on Ventura Blvd.
Everything was good and tasty!
This place is two thumbs up....way up.
I tasted almost all of the other items and it was nothing amazing.
Ones that wont leave my mouth bleeding.
It's a little more expensive than other sushi places in the area
You can get a baked potato instead but it costs $6 for that...lame.
The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat
If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting
The coffee was also just as delicious
We went in and the staff was really friendly m it was very clean and they have a bar on the other side of the dining room.
It is a little pricey for lunch though.
My last review still stands!!!!
I ordered Pho Ga (#17) and had it within a few minutes.
Tons of speed bumps and messed up lanes and directional changes.
Though the staff was friendly
The presentation was all stick on a slice of pineapple.
Terrible management.
Therefore
Lots to be desired!
We dine often at the St.
My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good
Compared to other eating options at TI
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
So she asks if they have the mango smoothie and the waters we ordered at the start and I slide a diet coke order in there at this time.
The menu is pricey but I think when I can afford it I will definitely be back.
The creativity behind each thoughtfully envisioned course and the absolute perfect execution is more than you can hope for in a dining experience.
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
Great steak
The grey trash cans
For us
They are spicy but well worth it.
BTW who wants or needs that much meat?
Ok.. I'll give it a try.
Worst martini ever!
The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
I really wanted to like the food more than I did.
It is too hard
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
Just a tad bit more like cubic zirconium in the rough.
I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up.
Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience
No
They have drink specials from 3-6 and you can get a Bud Light bottle for $3
Very sexy
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
Unfortunately thats not the case for me.
Never had a bad experience in a restaurant in a casino.
Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
I've been here 3 times already and used these coupons!
This was my third visit.
not even a hello
I always enjoy the open-kitchen atmosphere and we were sitting sufficiently close enough to see them prepare our meals.
The food wasn't bad
The desserts were a bit strange.
But my enthusiasm ended there... the chicken was dry and on the bland side.
They also have TVs so if you're a Football fanatic
For dessert they tried the mini pizookie with chocolate chunk ice cream.
My boyfriend and I love oysters!
I have noticed many food items out to other patrons that look delicious.
Uh
My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
I really do recommend this place
Amazing what that little bit of alcohol does to your innerchild.
And a selection of mouth-watering cakey treats.
Nice ambiance.
I would recommend saving room for this!
We arrived at 7 p.m.
But my favorite part is the grilled onions they bring out with the cips
Half of the table
But still quite noisy.
Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco.
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
They basically took all the work out of eating a NY strip.
When I told him we would not return
However
I'm always torn about what pie to order when I come - Jack Daniels pecan?
Hit or miss?
This restaurant is inside the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino.
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
I'm kind of bringing someone their drinks.
( tasteless).
i am a vegan who do not like fake meat.
We will give it another try since we live so close by.
We never had to ask for water.
The dish also comes with just the right amount of potatoes.
I've had 100% better French Onion Soup at a non-French regular old diner joint than here.
Finally
The place has a nice set up but the food was amiss.
We took it to go.
It was the size of half a rice bowl and we both looked at it like WTF.
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
Okay
I had a combo of pad Thai with spring rolls.
we got a salad that seemed to have been sitting around for a week and the pizza was terrible.
I *heart* this place.
Normally when I go with another person
#NAME?
So I was convinced this was going to be good
My brother got the chicken strips - also salty
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
Also my apologies that we graced this establishment with our presence.
After two I felt disgusting.
A good time!
Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations.
It is vegetarian and vegan but I wouldn't exactly call this health food....still a healthier option than most.
I'll still go there because the food
Actually no I wanted some clean dang tacos.
The structure of the tower with beams and rivets adds to the decor
It had a cool vibe to it
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
Generous portions and great taste.
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
My guest ordered the mixed grill and I ordered the vegetable biryani as main entrees.
The servers went back and forth several times
Food was delicious!
AN HOUR... seriously?
South west wrap
Do not pass go
I consider this theft.
My friend ordered a salad as well.
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
Sandwich was roast beef
I am not being flippant.
When my burger comes out
The food was just as bad
The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.
Can't wait for one to open in Summerlin!
Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
Waited and waited and waited.
Our antipasto
Almost like oven-roasted potatoes you'd get with a pork roast.
Maybe the experience would have been different if I dined in
He also came back to check on us regularly
It used to be the place I wanted to go.
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
When I get a sweet tooth and decide I want something ice cream-like
Its an all you can eat sushi place for newcomers of sushi and aren't too picky.
Best Tiramisu ever
My friend asked Is it good?
The pizza tasted old
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
FIX has warm donuts with dipping sauce on their dessert menu!
When I pull up to the window to get my food
There were only 4 other tables in there on a Monday night.
There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.
Service was good and the company was better!
30 beers on tap.
Don't get me wrong
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.
We asked a question
For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion
There are some folks who sing great and some who don't sound anywhere close to good so you don't have to worry about not measuring up.
As for the service: I'm a fan
Has it been ready that entire time but fixing the register trumped your customers?!
There were tables with guests all around us
Regardless of where I was in Vegas
I noticed that they have a great happy hour to offset the dinner prices.
Boy was that sucker dry!!.
Over rated.
If you look for authentic Thai food
The Asian woman working in the dessert station deserves her own paragraph.
We ordered 3 different noodle dishes
Their steaks are 100% recommended!
Slurped it right up.
The wine markup was about 2.5x retail across the board
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
Ironically
Finally
Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
I've never had stale chips!
All in all
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
Tiramisu
My breakfast was perpared great
We were furious plus it doesn't help I was so hungry prior to getting there and one of my friends husband was on his lunch break.
She told me about Mimi's and how good their breakfast menu was.
The kids play area is NASTY!
Great place fo take out or eat in.
I'm cool with that
it was just ok.
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
I flag down the hostess
Husband got a bottle of sake and I went with an Albarino.
We saw the chinese food and it looked alright and took a chance anyway.
OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
We're headed to Napa in a month and clearly we know at least one stop we'll be making.
Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?)
For breakfast - I've had the Devil's Mess - eggs
It was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless.
And
They also have a dining area separate from the bar.
Fries were run of the mill boring fries
Too hot to wait outside.
I started off with a vodka and Red Bull.
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
Given the cost and the fact I'm not going to eat a whole cow at a single sitting
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
For the life of me I kept thinking he said it was some sort of tongue but then after trying it I figured out it was cod.
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
His were slightly better than mine but not by much.
The only redeeming point is the seafood.
I couldn't finish because the cheese they used made me nauseous after a few bites.
Not good for the money.
I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!
We got sitting fairly fast
Make no mistake
I ordered a steak and my wife got a margarita and the nachos.
I was there for 15 mins and i had to walk to the bar to place my order.
The staff was nice
They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
Good value
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.
The food is good.
That being said
The steak wasn't the best I ever tasted but it was probably in the top ten.
There are too many other good and competent sushi joints in the valley to waste time here.
It was awesome.
I am in love with the key lime pie!
Service was casual and friendly.. We were seated as soon we arrived.
I just wanted to leave.
Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
I will not be eating there again.
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
She then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.The calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).
With this platter
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok
Luckily for me
However
Sorry
An absolute must visit!
Bread was hot.
And don't forget to add the fish sauce and any of the multitude of other sweet
11:55 - Finally got seated.
It is a nice bar/ restaurant to watch sports in.
and surely not worth the $40.00 plus a tip bill.
They also put an obscene amount of basil leaf on the pizza
All their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom Rockefeller
You've been warned!
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours.
Despite how hard I rate businesses
I take off the foil to the last taco.
They really want to make your experience a good one.
We ordered hummus and expected it to be served with pita bread
I will not return.
I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside.
They're really nice (but then again
I am from NC so soul food is in my blood (and on my hips!).
Obnoxious--as in over the top.
Overall
The country store has a lot of tea
The restaurant really has a nice atmosphere with the German music playing in the background and nice decorations from Germany.
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
Twenty minutes in they called #8 and it was pretty obvious they lacked institutional restaurant control.
Very disappointing!!!
The first time I got the hamburger.
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food
More than two people have to share a bottle.
do they make particularly weak wasabi at Hiro's?
Surprisingly
I was very surprised because this place received many awards.
The host and a gentleman were standing at the podium talking away.
The poorly constructed wine list was extremely over priced.
They have a Beer Club!
Update: 24 March 2008 Robert McGrath sold his interest in the Roaring Fork.
latte with honey.
Pretty awesome place.
It was served in a beer flute like glass.
Ambience is perfect.
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
Our waiter generously offered to move us to a table on the other side of the patio
Both meals were very hot and had lots of good flavors
I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.
You can spend a good amount of time playing pool or watching sports on one of the 10+ flat screens.
He got a bbq burger instead
I'd never heard of it
I had a combination plate with orange Chicken
Well you all lived up to the rumor....the hostess was very rude and unprofessional.
She offered up anything on the menu to replace it instead of my money.
The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.
This place is a must see for any out of town friends or family
It was kind of sad.
It texts you when your table is ready.
We also ordered three pizzas (for two adults and two kids - oh my) the margherita
I have been to this place dozens of times
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
It was also cool when it came out
She didn't like it at all
I ended up deciding on the grilled cheese to eat.
And even though they only take cash
The staff is always super friendly and helpful
While I personally would have liked to have had more cheese
I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.
This waiter was very outgoing and personable
Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!
Ordered the deluxe skillet.
I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to.
So I decided to check out their bathroom.
The dough was severely under cooked to the point of the crust to be deemed officially MIA.
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
Same evening
Despite the presence of Horseradish... could not provide enough flavor contrast to save the entree.
My sister recommended this place so we decided to try it.
So I ask her
They are served with three sauces..you guessed it!...All incredibly salty too.
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.
and we picked the stuffed mushrooms
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
and the burger/brats and beer for only $6.
The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi.
THREE DOLLARS ON A FORTY DOLLAR ORDER!
2 great burgers hold the mediocre fries.
The food was good considering the fact that they were about to close so a lot of it was put away.
Love the outside
We were promptly greeted and seated.
It was a little scary to walk with a plate of food because everyone was bumping into each other.
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
To mtop it off the drinks were over priced and the performance was crappy.
I think it's a obvious mistake
Would give an extra star for fixing any one of those issues
And the pho is much better when it is served fresh.
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar
After waiting an hour and being seated
Duly noticed!
This is a good joint.
The Macarons here are insanely good.
I'm not eating here!
The guy at the counter was patient in explaining how to order and such
Our waiter was very attentive
I wanted gluten free pizza
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
The setting of the place is very elegant and relaxing outside but still not a reason why a small piece of fish should be so expensive
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
To get in the restaurant
Stop turning your nose up just cuz its at a cheesy
You would think after a review like this that we would never return.
Very bad Experience!
(3 out of 5 on that service) Now for the most important part: 5 STARS on the FOOOOOD!!!!!
What a mistake.
Oh wait
Food was average at best.
The luxurious
Ate here on a Friday night about a week ago.
My friend and I decided to order a few of their small plates as a full on meal wasn't something we were looking for at 9 PM.
Gentle Strength moved to a new location recently and this has given them lots of room to stretch their wings.
I mean literally flaming.
Would have been five stars but the price to portion ratio was a little high.
Great food.
A must get is the prime rib and crab legs
Looks like the 4 items were sitting there for a long time.
I live nearby this new location
We won't be going back anytime soon!
They are tangy and a bit spicy...delicious!
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
My friend had the filet and I had the prime rib and both were fabulous.
A little pricey without the 50% discount
Very strange place.
Would go back for drinks or with a date who was footing the bill.
Also found this place on Yelp
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
Peanut butter & jelly gelato!
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.
Had some nefarious person stolen my dipping juice?
I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.
I liked that they were generous with the pineapple on it though
I looked around and I thought that the décor was alright
We then had an ice cream sandwich
Now I have to eat salad that's not pleasant?
Not much flavor to them
The patio seating was very comfortable.
We had received a gift card and were excited to use it.
I love my steak rare but this thing came out beyond mooing... it was also very under seasoned.
The fried rice was dry as well.
Decoration is much nicer than other places.
They have deals for lunch.
I docked a half a star since Roka is
On to Lalibela perhaps for our next Ethiopian outing!
It was delicious though.
I noted that because of Scottsdale rents and having a nice decor and tablecloths
And there is no other steakhouse that will serve it with the perfection it deserves.
The Yellowtail and tomato salad were just okay.
I myself
Their volcano nachos are ridiculously huge but good to share with a huge group.
Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!
The owner is great to visit and discuss poke
It was too bland
I don't care one way or the other about the manufactured healthy hype...it is pizza and when I eat pizza
....The recipe for the crust
That just SCREAMS LEGIT in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.
It was just not a fun experience.
The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
I personally love the hummus
Very convenient
Having heard rave reviews about this place from several friends over the years
The music was really loud and distracting considering the fact that it was today's hits that everyone knows and can sing along with.
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.
Ichiza (upstairs) is always slammed!
Overall
Please come to NJ!!!
You are overpaying for it's name and the fact it's Vegas' oldest steakhouse.
Both great!
NOW GO TO TURKEY THEN YOU CAN COMPARE UNTIL THEN PIPE IT DOWN.
Eclectic selection.
I don't know - it just seems like looking at Ra these days is like looking at an aging rock star trying to hang on to better days.
I still tipped accordingly because I too live off tips but I would have tipped double at least if the circumstances were different.
She told husband to bring it home.
Don't taste the onions.
The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
I've never heard of or seen this on a menu before
Until next time
Better yet is that this dump still hasn't figured out that they are in a service industry and that their customers need to be serviced.
It was dirty
The staff was very attentive.
And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
The owner used to work at Nobu
They will be missed.
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
dont go here.
Very efficient.
It took me a while to write this review because I really didn't know what to say.
She then brought my husband the tiniest
This furniture is wicked.
The sauce had great flavor and the cheese was fantastic.
I promise they won't disappoint.
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
I didn't taste it
I've eaten here occasionally for years and always thought the food was good
Whether servers are new or not
If I owned this place after working so hard to make it what it is with that beautiful smoker and exterior scenery.
What a great double cheeseburger!
Awesome service and food.
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!
The happy hour on Friday is great
Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona.
I had dinner here 2night on the way home from walking my dogs and
So the food was decent.
We were served a basket of artisan bread and each ordered the prime rib
I can't wait to go back.
Just need that little excuse to get out to Tempe... Getting there for EARLY happy hour and get a seat in the bar area the next time.
Would you like to have zero noodles in your chow mein but actually receive a small white bag of things that look similar to capt.
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
They grated some lemon on it probably to mask the unfreshness of the fish.
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.
On a more recent trip through the drive through I again had a similar experience in which the cashier at the window did not give me all my change.
My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright
I really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.
Service was slow and not attentive.
Classy lacks basic reading comprehension because most of his message doesn't even fit with my review.
I gave it 5 stars then
Some people will probably be irked by this
I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous
Most diners are oblivious
I think I would give this place one more chance and update my review.
The sushi prices were neither exorbitant nor cheap.
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
If you're going for the first time
Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
I came here yesterday with a groupon that just started.
Very good food
I ate here for the first time today.
Damn good steak.
THE lounge is kinda smal and dark .
Pretty much my BFF.
10 minutes passed....still no service.
VERY clean place and the person behind the counter was very nice and helpful.
You might end up like megan.
No such feelings here.
I've been here a few times.
Total brunch fail.
Prices are very reasonable
Restaurant week strikes again!!!
Definitely a must return for this gal...
Other food was just okay.
The decor is nice
The sandwiches are palatable
The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible.
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
Notice he doesn't say anything about my remarks regarding disgusting mozzarella and too much oil.
Wow they loaded them with cheese!!
We strolled in here one day for lunch and ordered a bunch of stuff off their menu.
And you get a lot for the price.
I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices.
While the wait staff is still friendly and works at the same speed they always have
Sashimi salad consisting of salmon
The grilled vegetables were good
It's really too bad I have to downgrade to 4 stars
I ended this incredible adventure with my favorite
Great Guac.
Just a great evening for not knowing about the food there.
Then she made a mistake in our order.
I was here for a business meeting and the nachos were just horrible!
There are a few all you can eat places in LA that are both good and well priced i.e.
the one thing i distictly remember is having to drunkenly sleep up on the A/C because it works so poorly.
Good food
I absolutely love the granola and would take granola and bananas as a topping on these acai bowls any day.
Taggia suddenly looked a lot more enticing.
It was absolutely amazing.
Hence the aforementioned beats.
Very talkative.... despite not knowing very much about the restaurant management.
I probably won't be back
About 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.
will definitely be back!
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
The batter here is also far too chewy.
We looked at each other in silence and thought how really weird this was.
Hawaiian Breeze
After we ordered I decided to check the place out.
I know they had a couple different options but I am not TOO adventurous... It was a goat cheese ravioli with a very very rich mushroom cream sauce.
It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt.
Note: The rating and review does not include any bias on the presence of the ladies
-- Again
Went for lunch - service was slow.
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing
I was mortified.
You have your choice of 6 soups and a salad that is custom made by the servers as you walk the line.
I think it is a big practical joke and the punchline is 5 years away.
In the end
Emboldened
Got the beef bowl that people were raving about on here.
Well we stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us!
I have to say though
And you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry and angry.
Needless to say
Mussels were different than we usually see and very good.
The booths were romantic and private
Anyways
The chips that came out were dripping with grease
Next time will try the salt-n-pepper
They do have a pretty legit gelato bar if that's your scene.
2 - The phrase Chicago-Style Pizza should be regulated like organic and kosher.
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
We were seated with a friendly
The only problem in the entire meal is the vegetables were barely warm with everything else hot.
The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.
A close second is the pork belly and the albacore.
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
3-7pm everyday
so yay for soy paper!
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
The atmosphere here is fun.
Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap
The waitress must have noticed the glazed over look and smile on my face because she rhetorically asked
When I pulled up to this place
We forgot to do so and they didn't have one available for us after dinner.
So finally after settling into our second room we got a rewards card for gambling.
Would not recommend to others.
Being it December
i'm actually going to get some togo tonight.
I wasn't paying attention and wow!
From reading the other reviews
Service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it!
We got quick service for our drink order - but got serverd in styrafome cups...really??
I mean really
To echo some other reviews: insane portions to soak up alchohol?
We were there at 5 PM and maybe 15-18 others were there.
That said
I was hungry so I ate several but woke up in the middle of the night and got sick.
Not my thing.
2 Thumbs Up!!
He started to fuss on and off during dinner.
Especially when I added a little bit of their Pico.
Pretty much all of the places mentioned have nicer atmosphere.
I suppose I could have asked to order something that was not on the menu.
For $17
If you are reading this please don't go there.
I loved the grilled pizza
Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
Plus
The prices are a little high if you have alcohol with dinner
My college town had a great alcoholic smoothie/slushie pace and it was bomb
They have a really nice atmosphere.
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
If you want a good Mexican meal with a Southwestern twist
Was excited to try the wings after reading reviews.
My suggestion is if you want Kathy's food
After one bite
I remembered this place on my to eat list from YELP.
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
Cute
There were tables outside
You need to make a reservation at least a day or two in advance!
I guess they were in a hurry even though the place was 2/3 empty.
Line system is a little ridiculous - different lines for different meats - which makes it a pain to try different meats.
I was expecting more exotic French foods.
The pulled chicken and pulled pork were a bit bland
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
We started out with an order of onion strings
There were so many people and they said the wait was well over an hour.
The food was great as always
We were about 10 minutes late
Gave us the wrong change which took a while to correct (not in our favor by the way).
we saw a coyote standing near the tee about 20 yards away and also a rabbit down on the fairway.
The manager that took 50% off the bill (after also charging me for food that we never received or ate) was very unatentive otherwise.
So I tried it
go in there and get something.
Delivery: 1/5.
Food was great
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
Prices were what you would expect for good sushi
Awesome selection of beer.
Now until our food came crab cake appetizers and ribeye with mashed garlic potatoes and veggies.
That's fine
Great food and awesome service!
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8
The gravy had no signs of onion in it.
Vegas Baby!!
It tasted old like it had been made days before.
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
Wish the owners had been there and if they are when you visit give them a shout.
Sitting next to the open air kitchen
I forget the menu description now
Later in the evening
The back room has tall bushes carved into the silhouettes of busty ladies.
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
As for the service
Order this or else.
She also filled the coffee fast and cleared plates quickly so we could get more plates on the table.
The food was barely lukewarm
I'm willing to give it a second shot
We declined and he did not ask us to pay for the meals.
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
Overall
Sorry Steve Wynn
I HATE having to leave this review because the Portillos in Scottsdale blew me away when I first heard of this chain.
For the prices what they charged
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
Bayonne-Style Corned Beef Hash Benedict for $9.99.
Probably never coming back
The television was on a novela with no sound
they put way too much oil which was a bummer cuz there was no rice to soak up.
I've worked at a 5 star/5 diamond restaurant but have my favorite hole in the wall no star joints with excellent service and quality food.
Friend's pasta -- also bad
Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy
They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top.
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
Never had anything to complain about here.
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
They have some new menu items that we tried out this weekend and very delicious.
The hosts were from Glenlivet
Luckily
My husband convinced me to give them another chance and we sat down for some lunch.
We usually get one or two appetizers or hot offerings.
I will
I had the burger
Please let us find another boba joint that is legit for our Vegas trips!
It was way over fried.
There may be 3 items cheaper than that and they're all small.
Not my idea of a romantic night out.
Then getting all the way home to eat it and it not being the right order is just frustrating.
I tried the sausage
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
The questions you have to ask yourself is
When I opened the sandwich
Pizza can vary depending on who is making it.
I'm stoked.
meh pretty much sums it up!
We come here for the first time a good time.
Will not be back!
However
They were awesome in catering to what we wanted.
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
Pretty same subs as every other location except they charge $2-3 more for the same thing.
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
There were teens and families with small children everywhere.
I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner
The sausage and cheesy garlic bread was pretty good
I have watched their prices inflate
How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?
He then had a slice of mine and he said the same thing
I'm torn between 4-5 stars but I'm feeling generous.
(Which is practically all of them..) I know its their signature flavor
We came here for lunch before driving back to Sacramento.
The rest of the meal and salad was OK but nothing to write home about.
I ordered a steak burrito and got chorizo.
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and got the thai chicken pizza instead.
I WILL continue to go to the original S.T.
3-7pm Otherwise pry wouldn't go!
So I'm staying at Caesar's Palace and they have a Central there.
Tonight I sat at the bar and chatted with the beautiful and friendly bar staff.
I got to enjoy the seafood salad
My boyfriend and I made a lunch reservation to celebrate his promotion at work.
Potatoes were slightly undercooked
The wontons were thin
I received what the chef calls the streak dismantled
Level 5 spicy was perfect
Even though the salad didn't look attractive
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd
I'll give her back a few prawns just for a few more noodles.
When I'm on this side of town
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
They could be really good
This is a GREAT place to eat!
My favorite is their mango
Not the quiet romantic lunch we had hoped for.
I moved from Arizona in August and I was happy to leave.
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
As the Germans would say... Nicht so gut!!
The service was poor and thats being nice.
i could shingle my roof with them!
I wish I had ordered the bone marrow ravioli instead
Oh
I'm taking my business elsewhere.
Food was good
I will say a couple of good points were the beef
Thanks for trying us but you seem to like the americanized version better.
If what you're looking for is a cheap (in price and quality) Denny's style restaurant in the casino
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
I would say the only thing that was good was their selection of milkshakes but I am not really a fan of sweets so can't say much about that.
This was actually a downside for me
The chicken dishes are OK
And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.
The best I think I've had.
But the service was beyond bad.
I'm so happy to be here!!!
Tasted like dirt.
One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
I mentioned it to my husband
The block was amazing.
i've had the chicken and the tuna.
Ordered two 44 strawberry fruit slush and one corn dog.
It's close to my house
One got extremely excited
She said our server had to cash us out
An old whipped donkey perhaps?
* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
You think?!
martini to the brim with the Well vodka is $7.
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
If you don't mind the wait
Do the math you idiots
the food is not tasty at all
One stand-out experience that halted my visits for a long time
SO FUN!!!!!
Ended up going to this Tony Roma's which is inside the Fremont Casino with a large group (my family primarily).
The cooking is done at your table over gas grills.
What did bother me
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
Mini-flying saucers
They serve a really good Borscht with an authentic bread cap
Bouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie
I had never been there and i heard that their wings were famous.
The bad: my sister ordered the sea bass which was served with clams.
These were so good we ordered them twice.
They used to deliver but stopped that as well.
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
Your order will NOT be taken!
Good server but food is not up to par.
each
AND it did not taste like hardwood smoked bacon!
After paying a $4 delivery charge
a very disappointing buffet in such a nice casino hotel.
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
Unfortunately
Although the food was delicious
Was hankering for a frosty-fry combination.
I had a pretty satifying experience.
Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
We will never go to any of these restaurants and I we will spread this to all of our friends so they don't go either.
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold
Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining.
THERE WAS A SAFETY PIN STICKING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE SHEETS.
I felt like you can get this stuff anywhere.
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
The chains
The Manager should not be allowed to talk to customers or be on the floor.
It is GINORMOUS so I would definitely suggest sharing it between at least 4 people.
There's nothing special about the rolls at sushi station
Didn't have Bohemia beer (hello
Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy
And on top of this experience
Not really a great impression.
The egg on the croissant had a crusty edge
Pretty standard mac n' cheese
The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
He expected them to be hot and was a little put off by them.
Try the corn and if you still feel a teensy bit hungry
The sampler came with small square cheesecakes and cream puffs.
We will not be coming back.
I don't have very many words to say about this place
There were three urinals lined up with no partition
I could not thank her enough.
FINALLY
We started with appetizers.
I had about $5 worth of food.
I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.
It felt very NYC (as I learned later
Entree...I ordered the 9oz filet medium well.
The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries
That is not a normal wait time for a diner in a business area for lunch.
We met people form Indiana
#ERROR!
Cannot beat this espec.
The cheeses did not present itself in a natural progressive order along the palette leaving conflicting flavors fighting over oral real estate.
Walked in & waited a good couple of minutes while he chatted with co-worker about the previous night.
I can think of any number of places I have been to that are just as nice.
I freaking love me some condiments on any day from anywhere.
Great atmosphere
I ordered a large milk tea taro to-go for my BF once and didn't taste it cause it was for him.
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
Just because they were plated all in one plate
Went earlier this evening with 2 people who have never been.
Dining area is empty except for one couple.
Once your food arrives it's meh.
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
If there were kinks
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day
For only $5.99 you can choose from a variety of different sandwiches.
Everything was there except my cologne & deodrant.
I felt like if I stuck some on my arm
I just really do not know how he can make any sort of living given the amount of traffic he was getting.
This is our new burger/fry/chili place.
Maine Lobster Pot Pie: Mr.
Now the food.
I've been to Serendipity 3 in NYC and this for me was a disappointment.
It is not fine dining in any respect.
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
The chips and salsa were really good
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mediocre food.
I noticed a display case filled with dessert-type items.
I've eaten falafel in every city
The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms
So the rest of the food must be the talk of the joint.
To our favorite Chicago Steak house restaurant readers
I've heard way good stuff about this place for a while and finally had the pleasure of sitting down and having some lunch there.
$8.99 itself is a very good price for this buffet.
I will be returning!
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
The spare ribs and the crab legs and the short ribs were empty when we came in and remained empty until we were almost ready to leave.
I'm super pissd.
I will be filing a report first thing Tuesday morning since it is a holiday tomorrow.
When I asked if they served them with chocolate I was expecting the way they serve them in Spain.
And service was super friendly.
it was sunday from 4 to 5pm and the place wasn't packed at all so the fact that nobody came by for a while at first annoyed me.
We basically waited there so long
I said no
The service was ok
I like breakfast but not here.
I think she had too many tables.
I really really want to come back (to spy on the hot waiter) and try their brunch because that seems to be where the real magic happens!
He loved the flavor that the white raisins brought to the dish.
When I hand out a 5 star review
Also
My advise- miss the driveway and swing into Jack in the Box.
I even had a manager come to the table to suggest some food items and a very good whiskey (Yamazaki.)
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
The shrimp wonton soup.
The staff was friendly
came here for post nye snack.
We arrived right at 5PM and got seated at a booth by the bar.
Spent a good 10 minute walking us through the choices.
This place is also good choice for hangover too :) I did gained 5lb after i left this place
Can't wait to go back!
This place was such a nice surprise!
I just saw someone else review about 50 chicken nuggets for 9.99
They were golden-crispy and delicious.
It gets better.
The biscuit was flaky and huge.
My advice would be to sell the expensive string wrapping machine
Next time we're in downtown Vegas
It was pretty much that.
I brought my daughter to the family restroom and there was no soap on the soap dispenser.
I told the server of the problem with my filet and sent it back.
Not the best slaw I've had but nothing to scoff at.
The waitress seemed confused when we asked her for water for everyone.
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill
The mocha that my friend ordered was stone-cold
Time will tell.
Don't get me wrong
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
which pretty much means
At the suggestion of another reviewer
Another good alternative might be Circo's big brother
I'll disclaim
Is this the best sushi I ever ate?
Lastly
Two very big thumbs for for double up!
It's like all the servers there not only are new to serving
The ambience was rustic
The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience
I'll let you know how it goes....
Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.
Redemption!!
You have to go up to the counter to order food.
This is the ultimate heavy hangover food and
It helped the time pass.
If I was in the area I would go back.
Pub Crawl
For breakfast
i ordered the plantain spring rolls and the main dish escapes me.
There wasn't much eggplant left
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
The service was terrible though.
Go to the register
Our reservation was for 15 and 14 of us were there within a few minutes of each other.
good sub shop.
I've never been a fan of buffets and still haven't been very impressed with any of the buffets in Las Vegas.
*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place.
My favorite breakfast place
This place is overpriced
I've eaten at Bunky's for years.
Some very good
If you check in on Yelp you get a free dessert.
Dry and salt lamb meatballs
It was packed!!
I just had them toss it out.
We started off the night with a country pate that was made on-premise with seasonal ingredients.
I ended up eating the grilled cheese
But hey Ezekiel's I will be back again and again and again.
Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.
There was hardly any spinach that I had paid extra for due to the confusing menu
Everything we have tried thus far has been awesome.
For serious
I had the seafood one tonight and it was very tasty and extremely filling.
Once we arrived there was a mob scene of about 30 people waiting outside and the wait was an hour.
I've dined here three times so I know the drill.
I love this place.
A bit intimidating place
I can say that the desserts were yummy.
The food was terrible.
All my servers have been sweethearts too.
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station.
You know you messed up my order then offer me to pay again for what I originally ordered.
That rice was gone in an instant and we had to order another rice bowl.
That's way too much personal info.
That alone is a wonderful welcome.
We stayed away from Coco's for a couple of years
Awhile back Red Rock had a web site that gave me 50% my meals at various points.
I've always wondered what a breakfast pizza would be like and I finally found out at my visit to Scramble.
I had the opportunity to try SOL at Monday's yelp party.
Just an okay taco.
I am so jealous that I don't have a Ichiza in Texas to satisfy my craving for an awesome dessert.
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
This place should honestly be blown up.
Saw the good reviews and thought I'd check it out for taco Tuesday.
My only criticism is the bar.
Soo soo good!
Definitely not worth $43.95....There was not a huge variety
But I definitely would not eat here again.
The Palms is easy to find in the Forum shop area.
The Torta Mexicana is what you want.
The cut of prime beef was tender
Why the chef couldn't make Bearnaise sauce is beyond me.
Do not waste your money here!
I have been to this place over 10 times... I am sad to say the food is getting worst and worst... What gives?
I came home and wrote this crying.
We barely had enough food to get over being hungry.
One star off due to an issue over the price of the wine we ordered.
The problem seemed to be a bit worse
It looked good.
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
So I got to experience
Yes
This is my favorite authentic mexican food in Vegas.
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
:) The quality of the food is really good and the service was great.
Awful service.
We were seated immediately
Everything else was delicious and fresh!
But it was a blistered nasty mess.
Won't ever go here again.
Great way to start a Sunday with family and friends.
Not even close.
Our food gets to the table along with my diet coke.
Look at my stats.
Also at the table was a house salad of sorts
Chicken Taco/Burrito- Pretty straightforward but still good.
Some of the highlights were the salmon with pesto cream sauce.
We get our check.
Come on an empty stomach.
I've taken a few other new people here and they all liked it.
But
I order their honey chicken katsu which was on their specialty menu so I figured what the heck and two spam masubi.
Not authentic but close enough.
It was a lot of food.
Food quality has been horrible.
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
Minuto was interesting
If our primary waiter was busy with another table
If you want to supersize your meal and yourself hit up the McDonalds.
The service here is fair at best.
They've got it covered.
It was fan-friggin-tastic.
I was puzzled by this restaurant/bar concept.
Their double cheeseburger is one of the greatest things California has ever given to America.
The bar downstairs is crazying during football days.
I do love sushi
My friends were not thrilled about their burgers.
Finally after they were done taking care of him than they came to the table to ask for our drinks.
Ok one more time fresh!!
I'm praying it wasn't.
Order Hot n Juicy sauce mild or medium.
Andre's Lounge is a quaint
lots of booth seating.
If you are staying on the strip it is a butt turd of a drive.
The dance floor is small
Vomit on the light switch?
Try them out!
Add to all that the selection of affordable wines by the glass and tasty boba smoothies and that's it
The sushi tastes fresh and we haven't had any issues with the rolls falling apart.
Drag your still-drunk butt out of bed!
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
Well worth the calories.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I will go back as they seem to be improving.
The bottom line.
The bottom half of the bun never stood a chance and was a soggy sponge in just a few minutes.
I'm also a fan of their Shrimp Killer and Spicy Tuna rolls.
The restaurant interior was hip and tasteful with plenty of mood lighting.
)
I would say the food was decent.
Very poor service.
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
Too bad it was a very tiny piece of short ribs.
Best service and food ever
The big night out is pricy
Rip off of the year.
It seemed glorious.
They were excellent.
YOU MIGHT DIE!!!!!!!
I was too full both times to try it when we went :)
The menu is limited but that also means one short order cook can service the whole restaurant.
The corned beef patties were good.
I'm hoping my next visit will be better.
It looks practically brand new.
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places.
This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in some time.
Their cheap breakfast is $4 for 1 egg and hash browns.
It didn't have the rubbery chewy texture but was actually juicy and tender like eating a seafood steak.
However
I noticed that the table next to us got their food a lot faster than us.
Come early (8am) and beat the crowd.
We finally had to ask a different server who got the manager for us.
Also
For the price (about $50 for my wife and I @ the Sunday brunch)
I have been coming to this location for quite some time now
Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY!
I said Excuse me
The decor of the place was great with a perfect view of the kitchen so you can see them prepare your edible art.
This is how a local pizza shop should run a business.
Kinda made me regret coming here for dinner when it did was nothing to brag about.
The whole place is one giant freezer.
This one is definitely a diamond in the rough.
Wait
mmmm... cardboard parmesan.
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
The waitress interrupted me to say
Kinda cool!
I did not really find anything i enjoyed in Asain section except for the Korean BBQ Kalbi.
It has managed to stay in business
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
This came out steamy
Maybe they added a few barstools.
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
He absolutely STUNK.
Check out the other patrons' reviews.
I was looking forward to having dinner here.
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge
The waitress apologized again
Beef Brisket is good!
Also the coat check is like in the very back of the club which is pretty inconvenient if you ask me.
5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie.
The steak was smallish and carved table side by a disinterested woman with her hand behind her back... never smiled or said hello.
I wanted food like nothing else.
I loved it.
The worst part is I love metro pizza.
for 40 bucks a head
The food came out at a good pace.
I see the same core staff and smiling faces that have been there for several years
It is pretty good for a fast food item
(Monday nights) pool table needs some love and drinks are a little pricey but great atmosphere
.........AND ITS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN ....... Good Riddance
I gave two stars because if you are looking for quantity for a decent price you will get that.
I like the hip vibe
I ate there twice on my last visit
I won't be back.
So we let him take the reigns and it was AMAZING.
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
This place deserves no stars.
Hamburger
In fact
You could graze here and not eat another meal that day.
I would not recommend this place.
The mozzarella stick appetizer was good (but the boyfriend [actually now fiancé!]
Then had dessert before dinner with the fried dough balls that we dipped in Nutella.
I'm not sure if I will try the other Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix.
Each slice had to be reheated in the oven.
You start to relax even before the waitstaff asks for your beverage request.
Reservations are definitely recommended for the weekend.
I thought it was very nice
very busy on sundays there may be a wait.
for the record we still loved it.
The prefix menu makes the whole experience even better because you just show up!
Sonic is a drive in fast food place.
pepper and I was handed a small one.
Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road.
In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars
To my disbelief
A server comes down and says
Bad day or not
However
I also expected that they would make the extra effort for quality service and cleanliness.
You could still smell him after he walked by.
Hmm..I cannot decide if I liked it or not.
The service was okay.
He wasn't given an itemized receipt so I don't know why there was such a price difference.
I went and spoke to the manager before I left.
The next thing I realized
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
We also tried a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dry and not flavorful at all.
LOVE LOVE this place!!
I should have gone to Yama Sushi.
Like most Las Vegas hotels and casinos
I probably would not go here again.
Tone it down.
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
The price is reasonable and the service is great.
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp)
We ate until we thought we would explode
Great food
I found pieces of the chutney to be bitter (orange peel possibly?)
Is it really necessary to offer 3 daily specials at a small cafe?
0 x $20 = $0 Oh well.
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it.
The french fries are hit and miss.
Went in for happy hour
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
I probably won't be coming back here.
This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in sit down area.
Today I placed an order at 12:30pm.
We went with the tasting menu and it was such a party on our palates!
Oh we ran out of dark rum so I just put some more light rum in it.
Quivey's Grove is definitely a nice Wisconsin experience.
Delicious!!
If you're going to splurge
Worst food/service I've had in a while.
The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar.
I mean
Horchata was wonderful and felt like I was actually having one
Oh yeah
The food is fine - it's bowling alley food and I'm okay with that.
Serendipity on the go is definitely not on the go.
This place is pretty good
So
I'm sorry but you could have just told us about the attire policy
I am lucky to have a partner who likes to share meals so we can try more stuff.
and I do not mean your regular lettuce
It's nice inside
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
Hot dishes are not hot
I love their fries and their beans.
I would definitely come back here again
However
Have been here a few times for lunch.
After hearing it was our first time they gave us samples of all the types of meats.
Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos
Guess they don't see a lot of that in here.
I feel like the waitress was a little disappointed to see customers walking in.
The hangover was like tamale with pork carnitas very different & good flavor big portion.
there was a funny smell in the place when we walked in.
Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.
Everything was good.
I've had worse
I have eaten here before but not in about a year.
We had about 5 of us
and sorbet were delivered.
Service: The servers are hard to understand.
Always a pleasure dealing with him.
They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches
Great flavor and epitome of a good cheesecurd!
This place just doesn't do it for me.
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
The restaurant does have a nice glass façade
Why would someone ever take Kobe beef
This place is pretty dang good.
A weekend of pure indulgence to say the least.
Was it worth it?
I will admit
They went ALL out on this.
My girl friend and I split one
For sushi on the Strip
The gnocchi sauce is spicy
Yelp
I will be back soon !
The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.
They have a decent kids menu for $6.95 and my boys got the bbq ribs and mac and cheese.
Probably because it's in a friend's neighbor hood
The service was great
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
The reason I'm not giving the place 5 stars is that the décor does not match the high quality of the pizza.
Not my first choice
And we found out that the salad was never even written down.
I started this review with two stars
Will be back again soon.
Oh well
However
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
Lobster roll and oysters!
Swiss cheese
I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.
A must try if you live in the hood.Total price came to $36 for 2 people including tip and 1 beer.
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
I usually like to try a sampler.
One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.
Strikes 4
The beer selection is good but the prices are high.
Met the owners at a different place and they seemed nice so decided to check it out.
It's been more than a year since my last visit to Gordon Ramsay Steak.
HUGE portions.
God can you give me a list of workers who make the drinks .
Hey Philadelphia Sandwich Company
The main dishes are in the region of £5-8 and they have good selection of veggie dishes to.
I must say I was absolutely amazed by the service.
Weird vibe from owners.
Herby leaves
There was hardly any meat.
Yet these people over charge and under deliver.
Good thing we had a groupon.
Now on to the important stuff.
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
Probably one of the best I have ever had.
The servers were still nice and friendly
Fusilli Sausage and cabbage was very hearty with an excellent marinara sauce.
My friend Kristina and I skipped in excitement through the doors and entered in jaw-dropping bewilderment.
Go To Place for Gyros.
They did bring out nice thick homemade tortilla chips to munch on with a great chipotle salsa.
It was a great spot for lunch with coworkers and our tummies were all happy from our meals.
Had the french dip (17 dollars)
The servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)
After learning my lesson from my first trip
just save your money and go to Oregano's where your never disappointed I guess.
It's a shame too.
Food was alright
I love the owner/chef
Now the burgers aren't as good
I've been just a few times since then and it's been just okay.
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
I went on a Saturday with my boyfriend who had never had Vietnamese food.
That explains the pricing; double each cost to compare apples to apples.
NY steak and potato - 10 2.
What I liked: The salt and pepper chicken wings.
I have been going here a lot lately.
I been to many many pho places in vegas.
We ordered three burros (3 way
The plus side
For me
The service was terrible
Just don't expect a nice big filet coming to you.
We definately enjoyed ourselves.
The chicken fried steak was a thin piece of steak and was overly breaded
Hum
Their menu is just too expensive.
Not too noisy and has good vibes.
And unknowingly agreed to be charged an additional 59 cents.
My wife enjoyed her cappuccino.
Better not just because you can get the full menu and the food is good
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
It was way too big to pick up and eat without making a huge mess
Apparently they deliver as well.
If I skipped the drink it was only $2.18 per meal.
If I went to restaurants to be treated nicely then this place would warrant at least 4 stars.
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.
I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty.
She came over to us and said that she was sorry but athletic apparel is not allowed in the restaurant.
The service was extremely slow.
After 20 minutes wait
This is the classic old-school Vegas gourmet room experience.
Seriously killer hot chai latte.
I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people
The food is delicious.
Is it really common practice to not have what you sell available?
Our bartender
Just got back from spending the weekend in Vegas.
Granted
There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.
My daughters told me about LBS @ Redrock Station.
Decided to check out Ground Control last night based on a reviews on AZ Central as one of the best wine bars.. I totally disagree.
Coffee was nothing special
No allergy warnings on the menu
So it tricks you into thinking the food will be amazing.
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
Not served as described on their menu.
The squid inside however
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
Prosciutto was mediocre; the lack of creativity begins to seep in our impressions as the dish is improperly paired with poorly cooked crostini.
For the people that complain about the price for good Japanese food.
We ventured into the restaurant which was mostly empty and headed outside.
Worst Thai ever.
If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
Its a decent dance club
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
Once again I learned people from other parts of the world sometimes have a fascination with the American west.
I wanted to love this place.
The pizza selections are good.
And not just the folks who worked there.
This place has gluten free pizza and uses daiya cheese.
The sauce was drenched when she got it.
That's when your little buddies post pictures of restaurant dishes on Facebook.
Some people have mentioned that the place wasn't very clean.
If I could
I had the California egg-crepe with swiss cheese
I had strawberry tea
So after 4 days of constant bombardment
I've visited both during the day for lunch and in the evening for a night on the town.
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
Four of us arrived at 5pm
Not at all runny.
It was so amazing Haha The plating and presentation of the food was appetizing and appealing too.
Before our food came our waiter gave us tiny glasses of sparlking apple cider.
Overall
I never had an anchovy in my life until I came here.
Spend your money elsewhere.
Gotta try the chorizo carnitas skillet!
The coke was OK but crazy expensive ($3.60).
Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
My last night in Vegas and after a week of attending a conference for work
We also ordered some nigiri and a couple of rolls.
Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food.
She ended up comping a drink but that did not nearly cover the almost $40 difference between the bottle we ordered and the bottle we received.
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
The rolls were sloppily put together
First - the service was really excellent.
The ranch tasted watered down also.
It says on the menu cheeseburger but it's a double cheeseburger.
We are regulars there and are never disappointed!
And the drinks are WEAK
It had a sign that said Shy Guy.
* Perhaps it's better on different night.
I came as part of a large group for a celebration.
#NAME?
Ordered veal parm
If I did return to the Marriott for a meal
Both came with plantains
Don't get me wrong
we started with the frog legs and lobster egg rolls.
The server quickly arrived to take my drink order while handing me the menu.
Also
The bread tasted old and came out of a plastic bag.
Solid brunch place!
The bar downstairs is okay.
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
Simply amazing taco salads and smothered burritos.
You offer sweet potato fries?
she had to come get you 3 times!!!
I love the innovative use of the storage container to house an entire restaurant
They advertise on their to-go menu
Ok
Daughter's steak was apparently chewy.
The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We won't be returning.
i know where sushi roku is located (arizona) for those who forget.
Yet every other table had a regular glass with ice water.
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
The place is pretty tiny but there was no wait for lunch on a Sunday.
I second the hit-and-miss service--we had to ask for more water
I am in love!
On the way out one of the servers suggested if we love the beef roll to get the pork pockets next time.
You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet.
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
Can't wait to return!
3 dishes?).
No mention of beer style or hops... just darkness.
They have some of the best pizza I've had.
I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing.
My overall experience is DEFINITELY 5 stars and I'd go back any time.
I cannot believe the following message that I received from the owner of this place.
My verdict?
But this didn't happen while I was there.
Got a small thin crust margherita
If you just need a quick lunch it's probably okay to go here
Asked if someone out sick?
(~$13 for lunch - 2 sliders and super fries) They add $2 if you order the Mystery Burger as one of your burgers in the 2/$5 deal.
We got there perfect timing.
The flavors are so fresh and work well.
The two other people that I were with ordered a meatball sandwich.
Chicken & Waffles (****-Kathy's rating... she's pretty easy.
Don't go if your hungry.
Very
The apple & beet salad was yummy!
This was a surprise birthday party for a dear old friend.
We had the crab lettuce wraps
My southwestern burger was too gooey with cheese and green chile and pork rinds(!)
Stopped in for a few appetizers and had a nice time.
At $8 it's a good deal because your eating rib eye that is filled with plenty of flavor.
Service was average.
Pomo occupies the space formerly used by Thai Thai.
i felt insulted and disrespected
(place was packed).
Pesce: MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO- You can never go wrong with this fish.
Definitely no need syrup for these bad boys.
It's nice lil spot for people watching and you'll see a lot ;- /
It seemed
Overall if the food was cooked better the way we wanted it I would rate it higher.
A co worker was in town and he was try to fine a reasonable steak house Bulls Eye.
The waiter suggested a mimosa
She was a very nice
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak
The service staff are primarily young people and
C'mon when your eatin good italian food you want the passion that belongs with the Italian spirit I know the owners have.
They have always strived to make the dining experience shine.
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
By the way the zucchini fries were awesome.
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here
That said
To start with there is salad
We've been coming here for 2 years
Red Devil is fantastic.
There is really nothing for me at postinos
And whatever they do to their broth
Try their excellent appetizers
What deserves 1-2 stars: - Service from waitstaff.
What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.
Might be a bit much for a party of two.
Anywho
I also had Shrimp Shumai
No value here.
this time she didn't get too picky.
The Bobbi
Got home and my son bites into an egg roll and it's cold.
I'd love to see Peoria as the home to more restaurant debuts like this!
BUT
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
Their pizza is alright and cheap but we won't be ordering it when we're in town again due to the bad service.
We ordered from Joey's instead -- 4 pies and an order of garlic balls.
It's family owned
That being said
I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area!
Our meals were delicious and made up for the not so good appetizer.
Service here is quick and they speak a multitude of languages.
What SHOULD have been a hilarious
Needless to say
I had read the reviews about Maggiano's catering to their gluten free patrons and looked forward to our visit.
This place is disgusting!
Get ready to drink as they often shove vodka on you for free.
The only good part about this restraunt is it is disgusting enough to cure a hangover!!!
The Pluses: Great menu.
One glaring thing that I always notice is that the manger never seems to be in a jovial or even in a pleasant mood and it shows.
I ordered a BV blend for 45.00
As Peggy mentioned in her prior review
Every time I eat here
We got the players!
But at that price who knows what you might find in your food.
The RI style calamari was a joke.
The decor was poor
The trout was very good.
Did not happen but I still enjoyed them.
I did not say anything it was my guest who brought this point up to me.
I haven't tried the other food items they have on the menu so this is strictly boba and shaved ice review.
for what...tap water??
However
Lemon curd was served in crisp cookie shells with a raspberry drizzle
Our server was awesome as she seemed so giddy and just happy to be at work.
However
Thai
Shut the front door are you kidding me.... What a gem I was so surprised.
I could barely stomach the meal
Recently it was our first stop after getting off the plane at 8pm.
anyway.... So I ask for the manager
One of my lucky companions dare to order yet another beer and arrive 15 mins later... I think I never got mine.
It was so bad
4) Shrimp tempura with ponzu-mandarin orange dipping sauce - crispy
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
While I was paying I chatted with the cashier who asked how I heard about them.
And
The fried rice was OK
From the start of our meal
In this place
Once inside you realize this is going to go one of two ways
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
The tacos were good sized
Disappointing experience.
So delicious!
Great restaurant!
Love this place.
The food is about on par with Denny's
I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club.
I couldn't even look at another food after the meal we had.
I forget what my Son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.
I tried the Montague and the Caribbean Chicken Jerk.
We were seated in a lovely booth with high ceiling and cascading curtains.
After attending a conference all day
I love the marrying of different flavors
My friend and I came here for dinner
My friend had one of the steaks and I tried a little
With better service
I would definitely eat it again
The flat panels all over the place showing sports
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service
Well we did go back and i will tell you what happened in my next review.
My husband and I went to Red Robin after attending the movies nearby on May 24
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
Great service!
Bad ones too.
The menu didn't look too bad though
They have a zillion new items and it is tough to decide
Taking any basic Garde Manger class will teach you that if there's salad dressing left on the plate
Great
I would have sent it back but who knows how long that would have taken.
Saw this place on The Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Had.
I also spied a chocolate layer cake
Probably 2 mins later our waiter came with our drinks FINALLY.
Whether the establishment has succeeded for its average patron is subject to debate.
The attention to detail is unmatched down to the cucumber mint water and the music played.
We won't be going back.
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
Ambience: 7 Food Quality: 8 Selection: 8 Service: 5 I'm the type to try a little of everything.
Sat down got our drinks and ordered.
This place lacked style!!
Someone needs to hand them a dictionary with the term highlighted.
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12
This place was way better when it was Cabo.
And there is a protein for everyone: chicken
Very impressed.
Don't bother coming here.
I feel like Serendipity is one of those places that you have to try at least once when you're in Vegas.
Pros: - Warm pistachios when you sit down - Fresh french fries (yes
Just need a pickle on the side and I'm set.
She took her sweet time shambling around the restaurant.
As is the norm with the Buffalo Wild Wings chain
This is my go-to spot for good
The meat was pretty dry
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy
As to the menu....To begin with every single appetizer on the menu involved seafood.
It was equally awful.
It took up less then a quarter of the pan.
Add in great coffee and this is a great little brunch spot.
Specifically the Chicken Wings
As we were waiting for the order
Probably not in a hurry to go back.
If you ever find yourself in Vegas
That wasn't the case here.
very slow at seating even with reservation.
On the plus side...Military discount..but not much.
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty!
This place definitely lives up to the hype.
Pluses: skewers and chopped salad with spicy dressing were good.
I got 2 bowls of soup and an amazingly delicious iced coffee for my friend and I for 13 bucks!
Strike 7...see where this is going?
I've ordered the craw fish and shrimp with lemon pepper medium hotness very yummy
The Yellow Pork Curry was ordered mild.
The taquitos were burned
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless
It was soft and the sauce was creamy and so tasty!
She delivered the drinks and appetizers yet there were no plates nor silverware and napkins on the table.
I can deal with that.
It was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten
It was a bit too sweet
Thai rolls - way to bread-ey.
I was VERY disappointed!!
I think I would rather have Ragu!!
She got the rest of our order and left.
This place is horrible and way overpriced.
However
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare
Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.
Only good things was the salad and the cappuccino.
The world would be a much better place if more people were like them.
I mean
The trashcans were overflowing and the floor looked dirty.
We were in Las Vegas last week and went to Fatburger 2 separate times.
It tasted like it had american cheese in it...strange?
This was one of the worse pizza's I have had threw the store I had about 2 slices with this one thats it .
I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery
I cannot wait to head back and experience the meat here.
Burger
I thought to myself
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
I couldn't wait to try it out
The rainbow wrap was delicious
if you dont like uni say so!!
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting
Absolutely perfect in every way!
I chose this place to have a rest from the steak meals that the husband required on our recent trip.
Based on fellow Yelpers recs
We ordered drinks
And by tasty i mean NOM.
We ordered Cheese Crisps.
Love the service.
2nd hand smoke is just as bad as taking a hit yourself.
The rest of the dinner a seafood pasta was just okay.
I'll update when we get a chance to eat there again.
My friends and I decided to get a whole pizza with 5 toppings.
HB had her Udon Noodles and Edamame (these come UNsalted).. I ordered Ahi Poke (This had cucumber salad
I was really disappointed; it tasted so bad I didn't finish it and I didn't desire a doggy bag to save it.
Still
Definitely better Thai in town.
The other 2 times I went there were not planned
Con: spotty service.
Even the salad was fresh and I don't think it was prepackaged
Six croutons on the side and some other stuff.
The sauce on the Pecan roll slices was perfectly caramelized from the french toast preparation and the syrup was just enough to add to the taste.
Great food at amazing prices.
Food was good
Love that they give you dough to play with b4 your meal.
Will return to again and again when we visit Vegas :)
If that is common
We ordered some sushi.
Cyclo has the best seafood crab soup!
The Gaucho chefs that prepare the food are actually trained in Brazil.
When we sit in the bar area
The service is very friendly
The fries were not hot
And that is a win in my book.
I also had the French toast w honey
The food was top notch and the presentation was astounding.
But then they came back cold.
Then our food came out
There are alot of great choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area.
I think you will enjoy it.
I pushed the onions to the side
Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis.
I do take out once a week for dinner.
The scallops were very large
To my surprise
Second
Service was friendly so no complaints there.
The real disappointment was our waiter.
My only concern in Brewdog Edinburgh was the staff.
You know a place where you can get a steak dinner or a french toast breakfast with actual eggs at a drive thru?
with the shittiest tone of voice you can muster and her head indignantly shaking at me like I just spit in her face.
Good times had by all.
I know the female manager was just trying to do her job
Pluses: nada damn thing.
The pork com tam we had was just a generic pork chop flavored with lemongrass and grilled.
This buffet was recommended to us by one of our taxi drivers.
That said
The menu is nearly intimidatingly (I don't think that's really a word) large
Unfortunately for us
Selection and recipes of burgers are out of this world.
The food was average.
The bennies here are like a deep fried large pocket of air (almost like a pita pocket) with little to no crispness.
Another first cafe that I've been to that downright told me to leave.
They opened right down the street from my in laws and we are there all the time.
But for the price-O MY!!!
One thing about the steak though: I don't know if the steak chef is color blind
I'd give the sushi 4 out of 5.
All in all
The so called champagne toast was BS - they only gad enough for half of the guest and even came out too late with it anyways.
It's not fancy
That pizza looks godsend when you're intoxicated.
I would frequent this business.
The biggest disappointment were the ribs.
I've been traveling to different so called Hawaiian influenced plate lunch places in the area and thus far they are only 'OK'.
But I found me a real strong contender if not winner!
They later explained why they falsely accused us in front of other customers of trying to steal there food but no apology.
Since it came down to that I'd choose the M even though its inconveniently located off the strip.
Where was the flavor??
I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first.
We all ordered and shared our meals.
The food was really good.
I was here for lunch and the dining room was darker than most other restaurants are for dinner.
Their Honey Brick Toast totally got me!!
Oh man
Met the owner and cook....both very nice conscientious people.
The food is very good.
Clearly ranking among the best if not THE best steakhouse in the Chandler area.
I suppose wagamama caters to local taste
Friendly staff.
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
I was not even going to give this place a star.
We walked in and walked right back out because they obviously had a problem with there plumbing.
a little tabasco sauce
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
No only that but the beef-like-substance was friggin' grey.
He posted on his facebook page
Insults
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
So glad I found this place.
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
Went in last Sat afternoon about 3:45.
After a long wait
Amongst 5 people
If you're going to waste your product
At the same time we never see our waitress again that night.
Good
Heard a couple bad stories about a rude server there
I'm thinking this is going to be a tradition of mine when HH'ing in OTS.
Overall
The calamari has a tangy sauce poured on top with mixture vegetable including good tomatoes and sweet plantains.
I know how much work goes into a operating a restaurant why would you add cleaning a fish tank and the expense.
My 5 y/o niece is on a special diet and had just eaten so we explained that she would not be dining.
We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now.
But my lobster had the not so faint smell of ammonia.
I would recommend it.
So I proceeded to cut through the crust to check the doneness of the steak.
It was melt-in-your-mouth type of meat and the portions were alright for the price.
Perhaps the Olive Mill is using day old bread???
It took forever to get our food so when the order finally came
They have a good options for their main entrees.
I ordered take out
I have to rate their Tonkatsu Ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me
I know I'll be making it a recent stop.
The gumbo was good.
The pizza was crisp but not too crisp
Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees
No big deal.
My son in law ordered a Bloody Mary that we affectionately called a bloody tinkerbell and the marguerita we called the sour lemonade.
It was great.
The service was great and the girl that helped us was very attentive.
The decor is beautiful; more modern and trendy than many Pita Jungles I've been to
Everything I've eaten there is of the finest quality
The Tacos Blah!
For dessert we had the chocolate tart--delicious.
Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola
needs a good scouring.
A lunch place for the blue bloods and blue hairs of Phoenix.
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
I ordered their well vodka for a martini and it was a 3oz pour
Sorry
I cant wait to try a pork pocket!
It's just good.
But once inside
He apologizes as he just happened to be the owner (surprise).
The food is mediocre and is replenished very slowly.
It was a good size drink (meaning I got a whole can of red bull not just half) hard to mess that one up.
Unless your into deep fried bananas
This definitely goes on my list of places to impress your palate
Hands down
i also asked for a lemon for my water.
There's also a great big patio with heaters and a nice social bar.
I hope the owner sees this and does something about it.
My family has ordered a meal for a take-out a few weeks ago and the portion size was Huge and had many sides.
Totally unacceptable experience we had.
The little bit of the lake that we could see was
Seriously!?
I had a caprese (sp?)
The service was fine
The menu looks just like cliche but the real dishes they have are fairly decent.
Absolutely perfect!
I asked him where the locals eat that is far away from all the dopey SEC frat boy tourists.
Or risk it and order something else.
There was a DJ
However
This was when the real wait started.
I think there's better service at a PT's...
It didn't have a strong bite to it
For a fast food restaurant it took 45 minutes to get our order because they literally fix one ticket at a time.
Halume is a goat cheese
foccacia served in the cast iron pan it was baked it.
If you're from another nation and want a taste of The Non-Vegan American west
This cafe should do very well and a nice addition for the downtown neighbors.
We usually have a rice dish on the table too.
From sandwiches to pastries to the better butter (peanut butter sandwich cookie) and oh oh (Ho-Ho)
Save your money and time.
Located in the Green Valley Resort & Spa!
There were at least two instances where someone took my drink order
I am not a huge seafood person
By far the worst dining experience any of us have ever had and it lasted over TWO HOURS.
That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words.
I kept seeing plate after plate brought out to my neighbors.
The drinks are good
The one concession made to American tastes is in the variety of toppings.
I had two carne asada tacos
The server was very attentive.
You have to enter through Poker Paradise bar/lounge entrance and hang a right...
My son's however was really yummy.
Ribs were fairly dry with the mac n cheese and coleslaw being more enjoyable.
did you tell your waitres?
This is a very
I've been to this place a bunch of times
tasted like sour chunks.
A good place to go if you want to order a plethora of other non-Vietnamese type dishes
This review is only of the cafe'
There are tons of great restaurants at the outlet mall down the street.
My husband and I go about once per week and we haven't even come close to trying everything on the menu.
#NAME?
All in all
In the mood for nachos?
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business.
Each time I've been in this place
When the restaurant officially opened at 5:30pm
I think I'll just stick with the Sammy's on Sunsent in Hendes from here on out though.
For two people
Everyone talks about Bouchon like it's the all mighty creator of macaroons.
Parking is tight
Yep
JUST LEFT Kaizen.
Also I had chosen this restaurant because the website says they have mariachi Thursday through Saturday.
They messed up my order and would not replace it
Not impressed!
That is when I stormed out and told the host up front that I had not even been acknowledged.
We saw there was one pizza on the buffet line and asked if they would be making more to put out.
Sometimes they get crazy busy and it takes a while to get your food but that's because everybody knows the food is worth the wait!
A must do if you are in Gilbert.
Luckily everything that came out of the kitchen was fabulous.
We went here early on a weekday afternoon.
We got in line at about 8:40 and it took up probably 40 mins to get in from the line up.
Everything fresh
Made that morning.
Greasy chips Weird
The frog legs were incredible
Probably when I have guests from out of town and someone else is driving so I can enjoy lots of red wine while I wait.
This was my second visit for dinner using a CityCoups.com coupon.
This is due mostly to the fact that the vegetables had become saturated in the grease from the mozzarella cheese.
I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach!
I would come here again but only with my brother.
Otherwise
I can't usually eat that many carbs in one sitting but I nearly ate the whole plate in one sitting.
The only thing Chicago style at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered.
But now we here
Meh
Not to mention you couldn't stack them on top of eachother because there wasn't a more rigid surface on top of the container.
It's not salt water.
Chef: This was teppanyaki
I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business.
Probably go elsewhere next time.
The crust was cooked nicely
The slices are HUGE
Hit up Satori on Saturday through Mondays night and you won't leave disappointed.
:-) Next time the Nutella Napoleon has my name all over it.
Found it unusual that they had to find some soy sauce in the backroom but employee brought some out.
China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.
On the other hand
Granted
The chicken pasta salad and chicken shawarma can't be beat
All in all we decided we would return.
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
You can never really go wrong at Lawry's!
Unconventional!!
Chips & salsa came and I'm not a big fan of the burnt flavor Roberto's salsa that they serve.
For a really amazing buffet experience
All said though
Just a declaration of my experience the one day
I don't get what genre their appealing to either and what is all that weird signage crap on the walls?
I can wear jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels and don't feel out of place either way.
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
But I don't like it.
He turned his back to me and walked away with no reply.
Let me preface this review by stating that I have been to Jersey MIkes before and actually quite enjoy the food.
We had a gift certificate to this place off of our player's cards.
But when we moved here to Vegas
Second the chips and salsa are okay.
We went for breakfast before we hit the road to go back home.
when the apps came
They are HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE pizza place!!!!
Great tasting chili with nacho cheese sauce on the top of some shoestring fries.
Hell no will I go back
Delicious meat
It's pho
Your meal comes with a variety of vegetable side dishes served in small bowls for all to share.
The antipasto tray was nice.
Like are you fucking kidding me.
Totally awesome business in my eyes!
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
I ordered my norm
The Pad tai was really bad
BEWARE - HUGE serving sizes.
Purchase a Group-On Wings- Wings cooked well-on the other hand the flavor garlic parmesan tasted more like fettuccine alfredo.
Oh it was so good.
Bollywood Sahara I atmosphere was nice but not everything is what it seems.
I don't know what the big deal is about this place
Solid all around.
I once was a faithful patron of this purveyor of the 'California Greek' experience but I've since tucked it away in the meh folder.
the pizza crust aspires to have that NYC crisp on the outside and chewy wet on the inside mouth feel.
My Shrimp Tempura roll was good.
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
My fav AYCE in Las Vegas!
My assumptions were not wrong.
Overall- FOOD: 3/5 Tasty.
The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.
In terms of price
Dined: 2008-07-06 After watching Ka
3 different kind rolls all in one plate.
- Manga Burger - crab and scallop dyanmite on a 7 oz.
I saw no please wait to be seated or seat yourself signs displayed.
Really cool.
Outstanding.
We ordered a som tum and got a coleslaw with raisins!
The fancy atmosphere and menu ingredients will always lure in the yuppies who think they're some sort of culinary authority.
once you sit down someone will bring some chips.
Our first visit was for a very late lunch or early dinner.
The food here is always AMAZING.
The pizza was GREAT!!
The ambiance isn't much better.
When we spoke to the manager about this
The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.
Unfortunately
We had to step over kids and backpacks to get to the host stand.
The food wasn't good.
The food is definitely the best mediterranean I've had in the valley.
Food was fantastic
All in all
I eat at the Scottsdale Humble Pie frequently
Will not be going to this filthy place again.
Great Christmas Eve dining experience.
I had an absinthe and with all the fancy prep
If they food wasn't that good here
I would like everyone to keep in mind that most authentic Vietnamese restaurants aren't going to be very upscale and /or clean.
And my favorite part: they pile the salad high.
old balsamic ($31) smallish portion
Think about what you're paying for and demand better.
I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious!
Next time we will sample some things off of the Tapas side of the menu.
Your servers suck
There's a buffet that's been on my mind...all the time Stu-Stu-Studio!
I can't get over it!
What I loved: The desert rotis.
What can I say??
I've eaten here before and it was okay
What happened next was pretty....off putting.
too bad cause I know it's family owned
Super Yummy.
You can't go wrong.
Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.
The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.
I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich
Overpriced for what you are getting.
The only problem
By the time I get to the register it's 10:30 and I am told I can't order breakfast even though I was in line before 10:30.
Black bean and garlic sauce was my favorite.
One who brought my food to the table.
I have never tried anything here that I didn't like.
My whole wheat bread tasted old and stale.
There's also a mechanical bull for those into that sort of thing.
If you're on the edge
Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees.
This was annoying because A) my boyfriend does not eat seafood and B) its fricken Arizona people!
Not as spicy as I like
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10
My friends got the garlic chicken and they felt a little skimped on their plates.
Wendy's Noodle Cafe is not like your other Chinese restaurants.
I've sworn off coming here since last year and haven't been back since.
Dined at the Coal Burger for the first time last night in Chandler AZ.
He started to argue and be very rude to me as I was asking to see where it said I had to pay this ?
I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full.
It was not very crowded.
Our waitress was a nice gal
$100 for 2 people and no cocktails.
The bathroom was funny.
Not bad
My sister chose this restaurant.
I went for the green one.
But even though the salad came late my wife could care less about how late it was because it was so delicious.
Really liked this place & will return for sure!
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to
What about a bun?
Do people even drink Corona after the age of 18???
They are a favorite of mine and will definitely be a favorite of many soon!
He asked if we needed anything else and I asked for some tartar sauce and ketchup for my fries.
Or watching TV
And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs?
for the price
Did our server offer to bring us bread or anything since she screwed up our order and we were starving?
Our server was super nice and attentive.
As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times.
My boyfriend ordered the Houston burger with an egg and grilled onions
BTW - I only rate the cost at $$ - very reasonably priced for the value.
We ordered three or four dishes each and enjoyed every bite.
The food is basically half of the portion of the normal size
Let me start by saying that I have been reading almost every review on here about this place
It's sad I like they're food too since it was my first job in high school
I had blackened red snapper with paremesan encrusted red potatoes and asparagus.
A large Kobe Burger fan.
So
If you are in the mood for a little change on your gyro get it spicy and with feta.
Grady's still selling his famous BBQ sauce in bottles from his new storefront.
The steak I ordered look and tasted delicious
It is huge and easily 2 meals for under 8 dollars.
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
Food was below average.
you wont be disappointed.
It's a no-fuss menu with simple
The staff seemed pretty nice
We don't need YOU.
The 'best' part was someone at the bar says
First things first
The others were great as well.
The bacon/egg pizza is good as is the calimari.
Exactly what we needed!
However
They were mostly quick to my table.
The ketchup was not empty.
I get at least 2 a week from these people on my door.
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
It didn't dawn on me until the next day to look online and see why my lobster smelled of ammonia.
The setting is Greek
All in all
Otherwise stay away.
I asked the nice lady behind the counter what are the two best hotdogs to get and she served me up the chill dog and a Chicago dog.
I will certainly be back for lunch or dinner and definitely will try the pho when I crave a hot soup.
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
Then my drink was topped off with ice so after about 4 swallows I needed a refill.
Amber was really good as well.
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
Finally
On a positive note
Beignets are supposed to be lovely and crisp on the inside while light and airy on the inside.
This happened two more times before the guy finally relented and took the incorrect pie.
It lacked flavor
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
A must place to eat if you are here in Vegas.
Best to find somewhere else for now folks.
We were promptly seated in a large booth - Dotty has some great booths... not gonna' lie.
I tried it as a recommendation from a friend
Still a pleasant experience
My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch and had the usual hour before we had to go back to work.
I did appreciate though how each drink came in a mini shaker and was poured tableside.
As a Floridian turned Arizonian the shrimp was pretty tasty even though it was from Thailand.
Not so much that we didn't get seated right away but when we left that wasn't the case.
The interior of the restaurant as well as the bar side are nothing fancy
Lovely little restaurant
Just say no to Jose Cuervo.
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
I've had it in DC a few times
The staff are super friendly and will take care of you.
Granted this place is probably known for their beer and not their food
don't order draft
It's not this guys fault you didn't hear him call your name twice because you were taking selfies at your table.
Things were over-seasoned and I wouldn't order any of these things again.
It's up to 5 Stars now for this great American Buffet!
Every entree I have tried is great
Food is always very fresh tasting and has so much flavor.
We have no idea what made him sick but he literally broke out into a cold sweat in the middle of the retaurant.
This was my first visit but most definitely not my last visit I will definitely become a regular fixture at Buldogis.
A nice maybe elderly lady
Spend your money and time some place else.
Wanted to try this place out
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
I had the ribs which were meaty
Appetizing comfort food comes in all forms including sandwiches
in fact
Winner winner chicken dinner.
We also got the flatbread (sans bacon).
So delicious!
It was a well worth experience.
I've been to Home Plate more than three different times
the presentation of the food was awful.
She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.
I was so excited to finally try this place and after the yelp holiday bazaar my friend and I were starving and decided to try it out.
After all that I'm afraid we won't be going back as there are much better options in the Valley.
Love this place.
If you love seafood
We were really looking forward to this restaurant.
We also added the Crispy Calamari + Spicy Seared Ahi to our assortment.
On our last night in Vegas
Standard strip prices.
They were only slightly cracked.
It was $6.38?!
The veal Milanese was like my Grandmothers and the pastafagoile the best in town !
We bough a dozen and could barely finish half.. My boyfriend almost yacked up one of them because it was already bad.
I was seated quickly in what seemed to be the busiest part of the restaurant with two large parties around me.
My bean rice and cheese burrito was excellent.
Maybe they just had a bad day
The food was good and I will go back !
Somone should confirm this for me!!
Because that's all they need!
A few minutes later our server advised that a snafu on the tickets meant they kitchen didn't get the order so our appetizers were on the house.
Did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order?
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
Time to bump up the star rating and start encouraging friends to pay it a visit before movies at the Harkins at the other end of the mall.
My husband and I gave them a try the other night at Fashion Square (I had been to Tatum for drinks only) and were very pleased with our experience.
I had to get the cook's name...Six.
Every dish is presented beautifully with lighter fares interjected between the more flavorful ones.
Good varied brunch menu.
I tried their grilled pork bahn mi and two shrimp spring rolls.
Order told him we every food no onions but still had Onions inside
San Jose is too far!!
Many menu options.
My boyfriend and hunt them out in other cities.
That's all you need to know right there.
Got the lunch roll special to go!
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
Seriously
Appetite instantly gone.
Great food might be an understatement
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
Soooo tasty!
Beer is definitely the way to go if you are drinking.
Had just eaten at a couple high end restaurants (the Sage notably) and had the worst service ever and had to pay for it.
I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite.
It also states they hav 10 years experience.
The whole experience was underwhelming
The worst part of the food is the desserts.
It looked like a couple slices of thick turkey lunch meat packed with fillers.
This is the very sucks place i ever seen.
I recommend the Hot Bagels and Deli to my friends and hope you give them a chance next time your around the Carefree and I17 hwy area.
Great casual (almost divey) atmosphere.
